## Quantifying Uncertainty
- In the approach thus far, we have had limited observability and/or non-determinism
	- Belief states which can capture all possible world states.
	- As representations become larger, the probability that there is no path which guarantees the goal grows.
	- Agents must still act.
- Rationality now depends on importance of the goal, and odds of reaching it.
- For example, use a medical diagnosis to show the insufficiency of logic.
	- People are lazy, so they may not follow the most logical course.
	- Ignorance leads to an incomplete view of the domain.
	- Practical ignorance: even with complete rules to the goal, sometimes it's not possible to do all of them.
- Realistically, diagnostics may not follow the most absolutely logical path.
## Epistemological Commitment
- **Ontological Commitment:** What a representational language assumes about reality
	- Logic and probability theory should agree on whether a fact is true or not.
- **Epistemological Commitment:** Possible state of knowledge allow, with respect to a fact.
	- In logic, sentences are true, false, or unknown.
	- In probability theory, there's a numerical degree of belief between 0 (false) and 1 (true).
## The Qualification Problem
-  **Qualification Problem:** It is hard to list every action required for a plan to succeed.
	- In logic, if not every single parameter is listed, the right outcome cannot be guaranteed.
- This is problematic, as logic is all or nothing, true or false.
- In the real world, there are many unknowns and uncertainties.
- Therefore, we use probability to guess at what we don't know.
	- **Numerical Uncertainty:** A summarization of uncertainty.
- **Knowledge State:** Probability, therefore, reflects the agent's state of knowledge rather than its environment's actual state.
