## Overview
- ***Phylogeny*** is the study of evolutionary history, relationships, and lines of descent amongst organisms
- Organisms with a high degree of genetic similarity are more likely to be related
- Phylogenetic trees represent the graphical relation between organisms, species, and genomic species
## Key Terms
- **Root**: Origin of evolution
- **Leaves**: Current organisms, species, genomic species
- **Branches**: Relationships between them
	- Longer = less related, longer evolutionary time
- **Nodes**: Species
- **Edges**: Genetic distance
	- Edge length shows evolutionary change
	- Not necessarily chronological time
- **Taxa**: Organisms/Sequence compared
- **Node**: Internal node = common ancestors
		- Terminal node = Observes sequences/species
- **Branches**: Evolutionary lineages
	- Time
	- Genetic change
	- Evolutionary distance
- **Rooted vs Unrooted Trees**
	- Rooted = Shows evolutionary direction
	- Unrooted = Shows relationships, but not necessarily evolutionary direction
## Why Phylogenetic Trees?
- Understand how organisms are related
- Ask how closely they are related
- Insight into evolutionary history
## Relationship to Sequence Alignment
- Sequence Alignment Method
	- Use to determine sequence similarity
- Multiple Sequence Alignment
	- Applied to a set of related sequences before a phylogenetic analysis can be performed
