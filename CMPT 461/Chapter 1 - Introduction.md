## Virtual Reality
- Our perception of reality is filtered through our senses.
	- The mind doesn't have direct knowledge of the world.
- **Virtual reality** uses computers to create virtual environments in which one can *navigate* and *interact*.
- It is easy to trick the mind; simply alter the data from senses.
	- However, it is very difficult to trick all the senses simultaneously, even if we cannot pinpoint what is precisely wrong.
- The principal means of acquiring information is done visually, followed by sound and haptics.
	- Real-time graphics and a stereoscopic display are highly important.
- The eventual goal of VR is to create an experience that it it practically indistinguishable from reality.
## Basic Concepts
#### **Immersion**
- An objective concept
- The configuration of the UI while in a VR app
- Based on how many percepts the user has
	- Fully-immersive (Head mounted display (HMD))
	- Semi-immersive (large projection screen)
	- Non-immersive (desktop-based VR)
#### Presence
- Suspended belief
- Willingness to overlook limitations of the medium and behave as though it is a real situation
- Noted by how similarly people behave in VR to how they would in real life
	- Is the user involved and having emotional reactions?
- There is a difference between presence and involvement
	- You can watch a hockey game and be present, while not being involved in the game.
- VR produces a lot of involvement, in spite of non-immersion.
## Multimodal Experiences
- Using more than one mode of behaviour or action.
	- Engage multiple human senses
- Misalignment between stimuli can lead to nausea
- Immersion increases with more stimuli
- Text, illustrated text, audio or video, audio and video, audio/video/haptic
## Reality Spectrum
- **Virtual Reality** (VR) - 100% in a visual, digital world.
- **Augmented Reality** (AR) - Digital images layered on top of your view.
- **Mixed Reality** (MR) - Digital objects which can interact with your real world.
- **eXtended Reality** (XR) - Umbrella term for immersive technologies like the above.
#### A Brief History of VR
- 1962: Sensorama
	- Vehicle simulator with sounds, 3D slides, smell/wind
	- No computer
	- No interactivity
- 1963: **Ivan Sutherland** (father of VR)
	- Designs "Sketchpad", the origin of CAD
- 1968: First stereoscopic display
- 1967-90: GROPE
	- Frederick Brooks' haptic interface
- 1978: Aspen Movie Map
	- Primitive form of Google Maps street view
- 1980s: VIEW (Virtual Interface Environment Workstation)
	- This was the first true VR system
	- Very immature
- 1985: VPL research starts to sell VR goggles and gloves
- 1990s: A rush to develop consumer VR products that failed, as the technology wasn't ready yet
	- VPL goes under
- 2016: Oculus Rift, the first fully-immersive VR headset
- 2024: Apple Vision Pro Release and failure
