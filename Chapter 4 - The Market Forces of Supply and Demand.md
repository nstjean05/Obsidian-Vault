- **Supply** and **Demand** are two words often used by economists.
	- They are what makes market economies work.
	- They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at which it is sold.
	- If you want to know how any event or policy will effect the economy, you must first think about how it will affect *supply* and *demand*.
	- These terms refer to the behaviour of people at they interact with one another in competitive markets.
#### What is a market?
- A group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.
- **Buyers** as a group determine the demand for a product.
- **Sellers** determine that product's supply.
- Markets can take many forms.
	- **Highly organized**
		- Such as those for many agricultural commodities.
	- **Relatively unorganized**
		- Such as those for ice cream in a particular town.
	- **Competitive**
		- There are many buyers and sellers, such that each has a negligible impact on market price.
		- Price and quantity are determined by all buyers and sellers as they interact with the marketplace.
		- We will often assume that markets are **perfectly competitive**, meaning all goods offered for sale are all exactly the same.
			- Buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price.
		- At the market price, buyers may buy as much as they like, and sellers may sell as much.
#### Demand
- The demand curve illustrates the relationship between price and quantity demanded.
- **Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good that buyers are willing to buy and sell.
- **Law of Demand**: The claim that, other things equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises.
- **Demand Schedule**: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
- **Demand Curve**: A graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
- **Market Demand**: The sum of all the individual demands for a particular good or service.
