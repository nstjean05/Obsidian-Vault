##### Appropriateness
- Why am I using this language for this problem?
- Is it highly important that this program is readable?
	- Maintenance
	- Lessens how cryptic the code is
- How simple is this code to understand?
	- Can someone easily learn an use it?
##### Orthogonality
- A class of syntax which...
	- has only one meaning in every context.
	- is always used in the same way in that context.
	- can, however, be overdone.
##### Control Statements
- Selection (IF, CASE)
- Repetition (WHILE, REPEAT, LOOP, FOR)
- Doesn't have GOTO
##### Data Types
- Does the type distinguish between a whole/float type?
- Is Boolean a first-class citizen?
	- Is it T/F value actually assigned, or simply depicted as such?
- Does the program have...
	- enumerations?
	- ranges?
	- pointer types?
	- class types?
##### Structured Types
- Arrays (indexing)
- Records (field selection)
- Sets (elements, operations)
##### Abstract Data Types
- How?
- Where (library)?
- Relationship between the library and built-in types?
	- Are the lib types treated differently?
- Blueprints?
	- Ex. If you want to def a numeric type, maybe there is a blueprint that shows how a numeric type must be applied within the program, and you must follow that blueprint.
