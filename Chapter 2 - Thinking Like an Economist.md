## The Economist as a Scientist
- Economists try to address their subject with a scientist's objectivity.
#### The Scientific Method
-  Involves observation, theory, and more observation.
- Economists use theory and observation like other scientists, but they do face an obstacle that makes their tasks especially challenging:
	- Experiments are often difficult in economics.
#### The Role of Assumptions
- Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand
	- The art in scientific thinking is deciding which assumptions to make
#### Economic Models
- Economists use models to learn about the world.
	- Often composed of diagrams and equations.
- Economic models omit many details to allow us to see what is truly important.
- Every model is built with assumptions.
