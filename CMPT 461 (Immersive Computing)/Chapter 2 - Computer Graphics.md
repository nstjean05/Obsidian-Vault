## 3D Modelling
- Drawing with 3D graphics on a computer screen
- Geometric representations are ways to describe the arrangement of 3D vertices to create 3D shapes
- 3 Basic Primitives:
	- **Points**: The simplest primitives
	- **Curves**: Approximated by lines or points
		- Powerful geometric representations
		- Use to describe complex 3D surfaces
	- **Polygons**: Used by graphics cards to approximate any 3D surface
### Triangles
- Simples polygon
- Most efficient for rendering
- More triangles used, more accurate the surface
### Tessellation
- A **tessellation** is a pattern made by repeating shapes that fit together
- They utilize:
	- Regular polygons
		- Triangles, squares, hexagons
	- Transformations
		- Translation, rotation, reflection
- In CS, *tessellation* is the process of subdividing a surface into a mesh of polygons
	- Tessellation ≈ Triangle Subdivision
- *Vertex Set* = A dataset of polygons which divide a scene into renderable structures
