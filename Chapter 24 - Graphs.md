## Graph Nomenclature
- Similarly to trees, *graphs* are made up of nodes, and the connection between those nodes.
- On graphs, we refer to nodes as *vertices* and refer to connections as *edges*.
- Vertices are typically referred to with a name.
- An *undirected graph* is a graph where the pairings representing the edges are unodered.
- A graph G = (V,E) is composed of:
	- V: set of *vertices*
	- E: set of *edges* connecting the *vertices* in V.

- A graph G is an ordered pair (V,E) consisting of the vertex set (V) and edge set (E)

###### Graph Applications
- Electronic circuits.
- Networks (roads/flights/communications).
- Visibility problems.
## Undirected Graphs
- An edge in an undirected graph may be traversed in either direction.
- **Adjacent/Neighbours**: Two vertices when there is an edge connecting them.
- **Self Loop/Sling**: An edge of a graph that connects to itself.
- **Complete**: It has the maximum number of edges connecting vertices.
- **Simple Graph**: A graph with no loops nor multiple edges.
- **Path**: A sequence of edges that connects two vertices in a graph.
	- **Simple**: Each vertex is distinct.
	- **Circuit**
