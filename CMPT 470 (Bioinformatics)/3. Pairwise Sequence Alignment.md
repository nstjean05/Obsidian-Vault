## Sensitivity and Specificity
- True and false positives
	- True Positive == Signal and detection are positive
	- True Negative == Signal and detection are negative
	- False Negative == Signal is positive but detection is negative
	- False Positive == Signal is negative but detection is positive
- **Sensitivity** is the probability of correctly predicting a positive example
	- S$_n$ = $\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$
- **Specificity** is the probability of predicting a negative example
	- S$_p$ = $\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$
	- Or the probability that positive prediction is correct
