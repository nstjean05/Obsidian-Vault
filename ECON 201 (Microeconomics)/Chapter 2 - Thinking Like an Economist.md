## The Economist as a Scientist
- Economists try to address their subject with a scientist's objectivity.
#### The Scientific Method
-  Involves observation, theory, and more observation.
- Economists use theory and observation like other scientists, but they do face an obstacle that makes their tasks especially challenging:
	- Experiments are often difficult in economics.
#### The Role of Assumptions
- Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand
	- The art in scientific thinking is deciding which assumptions to make
#### Economic Models
- Economists use models to learn about the world.
	- Often composed of diagrams and equations.
- Economic models omit many details to allow us to see what is truly important.
- Every model is built with assumptions.
#### Model: Circular-Flow Diagram
- A visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.
- It would make sense to add the government as an additional participant (green rectangle) in this model.
	- Take taxes from both firms and households.

#### Model: Production Possibilities Frontier
- A graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology.
- A point on the graph is inefficient if you can increase the production of one, without sacrificing the production of the other. Ex. Point D
