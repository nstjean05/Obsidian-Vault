- An exploration of the benefits which buyers and sellers receive for taking part in a market, and how a society can make these benefits larger.
- Concludes with the realization that the equilibrium of supply and demand in a market will maximize the total benefits received by buyers and sellers.
- **Welfare Economics**: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being.
	- The study of it begins by looking at the benefits buyers receive from participating in the market.
- CP + PS = TS
	- Consumer Surplus (CP), Producer Surplus (PS), Total Surplus (TS
	- Note that the total surplus is maximized at equilibrium.
- **Willingness to Pay**: The maximum amount that a buyer will pay for a good.
- **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the price you pay, and the price you are willing to (Willing Payment - actual payment).

1. Find marginal buyer's WTP at Q = 10
	- At Q = 10, marginal buyer's WTP is $30.
2. Find CS for P = $30
	- CS = $\frac{1}{2}$ * 10 * $10 = $50
Suppose P falls to $20. How much will CS increase due to...
3. ... Buyers entering the market?
	- CS for the additional buyers = $\frac{1}{2}$ * 10 * $10 = $50
4. ... Existing buyers paying a lower price?
	- Increase in CS on initial 10 units = 10 * $10 = $100
