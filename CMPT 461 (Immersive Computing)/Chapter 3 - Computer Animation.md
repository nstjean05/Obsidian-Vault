### Stop-Motion Animation
- Animate a jointed model and record the different positions on a single frame each
- Used in visual effects in live action films from the 1930s-50s
	- King Kong, etc.
- Miniature models with clay, rubber skin, and a wire skeleton
### Animatronics
- Computer-controlled models which can be animated in real-time
- Eliminate the need for composing later in production
- Programmed with forward and inverse kinematics software
### Performance Animation
- Live character controls the performance of an animated character
- Puppets/actor in a suit
### Character Animation
- Bring life to imagined or virtual characters
- The highest form of animation
- Created using a combination of inverse and forward kinematic techniques, and motion capture
### Effects Animation
- Animation which isn't character oriented
- Natural phenomena (rain, snow, smoke, rivers, etc.)
- Special lighting effects
- Techniques like particle systems, procedural techniques, and dynamic simulations
