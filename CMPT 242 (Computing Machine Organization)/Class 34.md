- **Note:** Because of the overhead issues...
	- Adding more processors is ineffective beyond a certain point
		- Things may get worse as overhead increases more than the time saved by adding more processors.
	- Multiprocessing machines do give the best performance on complex operations/computations.
	- BUT, I/O is always the worst bottleneck.
		- Non I/O problems can be sped up with MP
		- Metric: Speedup $T_1/T_n$ time for one or many processors
- **Assorted Issues**
	- Systems where multiple processors access the same data are inherently slower than when each has its own data.
		- Suspend requestors
