## Arabian Contexts
- *The Haram* - The Forbidden Triangle
	- Within the borders of Mecca, Medina, and Bedr
	- No wars, weapons, etc. allowed in this holy region
- *Jahiliyyah*
	- Arabic for *ignorance*
	- When you existed in the time of jahiliyyah, you lived before having the revelation from God, and are therefore not bound by the law.
	- People of this time get to go to heaven.
	- If you die today, then you will be judged according to your books of life.
- Three main trade routes through the ANE
	1. Silk road: Damascus --> Babylon --> Iran --> China
	2. Nile route: Alexandria --> Red sea --> around Yemen/Oman --> India/China
	3. Desert roads: A series of roads connecting Damascus and areas between the Red Sea and Persian Gulf
- It was very dangerous in the region of Arabia, so attempts to Christianize it were rare and failing
- Locals built cisterns throughout Arabia which collected water during rain, allowing caravans to get water.
	- There used a mix of Arabic/Sabean on signs so that outsiders couldn't read it and find the water
## Pre-Islamic Life
- Early pre-Islamic civilisations occurred around 1,000–2,000 BC.
	- One example of this was the Bedouins, who regularly voted in their wisest as a leader, calling them the *sheikh*
- However, there were no stable, large political entities
- Small minorities of Jews and Christians were scattered
- Most daily activities were done at night, since it is so hot during the day.
	- Daily life was harsh
	- Lots of afternoon leisure time
		- Couldn't sleep like some other cultures (such as a siesta in Mexico), since it was too dangerous around.
	- This led to great development of music, literature, and storytelling
- Led to learning about the stars and moon, as most walking was done at night.
## Economic Components
- Three main groups of people:
	- Bedouins
	- Farmers
	- Traders
### Bedouins
- Nomadic pastoralists of sheep and cows
- Regular raids on one another and caravans
- Small scale town trading
### Farmers
- Farming the land was difficult
- Easy to get raided
- Rain was infrequent, soil was bad, no irrigation
### Traders
- These are the people who lived in cities, forming the economic and political elite
- Carrying luxury goods from the Indian ocean region to southern Arabia and the Mediterranean
- **Mecca** was the most important trade center in Arabia, dominated by the Quraysh tribe
	- This is also the locations of the **Kaaba**, founded by Abraham
	- People had come here for centuries, even before Islam
	- Islam somewhat took over the habit of this pilgrimage, as it brings in wealth
## Religion
- Christianity was not active in the region, pre-Islam
- There were a few tribes practising Judaism
- Pagan Arabs made up the majority, believing in ~360 Gods and Goddesses
	- Allah was a religious reality for few Arabs
	- Arabia was a highly polytheistic environment
	- Held beliefs in a myriad of demons, djinn, demigods, etc.
		- These were seen as evil characters
	- Their beliefs are seen through their stories of genies, ghouls, etc.
		- As seen in the *One Thousand and One Nights* stories
- Both the sun and moon were worshipped, the moon being superior
- **Moon**
	- Brings coolness, light, and shade
	- Signifies a nomadic lifestyle
- **Sun**
	- Heat, fire, and hell were associated
	- Agricultural lifestyle
	- Sun was viewed as an enemy, depriving them of water, pasture, etc.
- **Al Manat** and **Al Uzza** were the two primary goddesses
	- Important as they are female Gods, sexualized, and allowed to have icons made of them.
	- Invited orgies and an open sex life
	- Women of low class or slavery were not allowed to wear a head covering, as a point of shame
- Islam then comes and swings the pendulum all the way to the other side.
	- A major shift occurs at Mecca, as they cannot drink alcohol, have prostitution, drugs, etc.
	- All women now have the right to wear a head covering
		- *Note: this is a right, not an obligation*
- The 360 idols are found surrounding the Kaaba
- Animal and human sacrifice (to the goddess Venus) was common
	- It is said that Muhammad himself gave sacrifices to Venus
- Since the people were Bedouins, there were no graveyards
	- The body had to be buried before the sun went down, or within 24 hours
	- This contributed to the idea of spirits as the ancestors may not be happy they were left there when they died.
- This translated to Islam, which has very specific hygiene and burial rights.
## Culture
- The Qur'an's significant stories demonstrate a derivation from the New Testament
- The Bedouin's love of poetry was Muhammads only cultural legacy
- Qur'an doesn't mention head coverings, but the **Hadith** has four mentions of Muhammad talking about the *hijab*
	- It is unclear in the Hadith of whether the hijab refers to a head covering or not
	- A *niqab* is a face covering up to the eyes
	-
