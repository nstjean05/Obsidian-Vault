## Islam's Family Tree
- Isaac is important to Christianity, since he is the son of Sarah, Abraham's 'true' wife
- Ishmael is important to Islam, since his lineage leads to Muhammad
	- Furthermore, Islamic thinking tracks by the father, not the wife(s)
	- Additionally, Ishmael is Abraham's firstborn
- The second book in Islam is called the *Hadith*, which is a history
	- Similar to the Bible's gospels
## Early Life
- Muhammad was born during 'the year of the elephant'
	- A war between Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, wherein a failed assault occurred on Mecca using elephants
- His mother died when he was 6 years old, and his father just before his birth
- Born to a respectable but not wealthy family
	- Sent to live with his grandfather, who died two years later
	- Went to live with his uncle, who had a son called Ali. They became like brothers
- Often in paintings, if two eyes are shown then they are 'good guys', but only one eye indicates 'bad' people
- Faces of holy people are covered in Islam, and this is seen by Muslims as a shortcoming of Christianity
	- If you put your own 'spin' on an image, this allows people to have an imagination, and inaccuracies
## Miracles
- Every year there was an argument at Meccah about who would carry out the black stone (meteorite)
	- Muhammad proposed that it was put on a carpet and someone from each of the tribes would carry it together, so that no one was greater than another
- Muhammad didn't do any miracles in the same way as Jesus
	- Muslims respect Jesus for doing so many of these
- Muhammad got married to Kadija at 25, which gave him financial stability since his wife had business in trading
## Revelations
- In 610 AD, Muhammad received the first of many revelations while meditiating and praying in the desert.
- He was commanded by Gabriel to teach all people two things;
	1. An unquestioned belief in God (Allah)
	2. A deep commitment to social justice
- This was miraculous, as he was unable to read nor write, but in this instance did both
- Qadr 97:1-5
	- He begins to doubt himself, but Kadija reaffirmed him
- He is taken up to heaven on a horse, where he meets the prior prophets, who tell him that he is the final prophet
- Muslims argue that in the time of Moses, Judaism was correct. In the time of Jesus, Christianity was correct. Since the time of Muhammad, Islam is correct.
	- We must use the most updated version
	- The issue with Christians are that they're stuck in the second message.
