- **Note:** Because of the overhead issues...
	- Adding more processors is ineffective beyond a certain point
		- Things may get worse as overhead increases more than the time saved by adding more processors.
	- Multiprocessing machines do give the best performance on complex operations/computations.
	- BUT, I/O is always the worst bottleneck.
		- Non I/O problems can be sped up with MP
		- Metric: Speedup $T_1/T_n$ time for one or many processors
- **Assorted Issues**
	- Systems where multiple processors access the same data are inherently slower than when each has its own data.
		- Suspend requestors on a task queue
	- Reassembling the parallel processed data must respect the data order, NOT the time of completion
	- Symmetric systems have the advantage that only instruction set need be learned, but you may thereby lose performance
	- To check results, you may need a redundant system.
		- Different programs on different hardware to check results
	- Looser coupling than multiple-CPU is possible when:
		- Standalone computers work on a problem with high computation and low communication needs.
		- This is called cluster computing (used by most AI systems)
		- For example, a high demand web server could load balanced over a cluster of machines to increase throughput
- **Pipelining**
	- Refers to any architecture in which information or code flow through stations or stages each of which interacts with the flow
	- Can be implemented in
	- A - Hardware, Some chips have extensive instruction pipelines in the CPU
	- B - Software, UNIX uses this all the time
