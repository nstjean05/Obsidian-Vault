##### vonNeumann Architecture
- 4 Fundamental Principles of the architecture
	- Binary coding is fundamental to all languages, as this is how computers store information.
	- Stored programs in memory separate from the CPU
	- Instructions and data fetched from memory to CPU
	- Sequential execution
- **Not all languages are vonNeumann** (e.g. Lisp, Scheme), although they have to reside on vonNeumann architecture.
- Variables represent memory locations
- Assignment statements model moving data.
	- Called *piping*
