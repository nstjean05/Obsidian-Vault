- Does God have a different degree of presence in some places than others?
- How meaningful is that presence, and how do we associate places with presence?
- **Augustine's Two Cities**
	- Either have love for God, or love of things of this world
	- Love of this world is the desire for power, to satiate worldly desires
- **Transience** of the human condition - we will die
	- The answer to this pain of loss is immortality - going to heaven
- Humans are aware of death, and don't want to
	- Machines are not aware that they will die, but may perhaps develop that in the future.
- Moments in time can define us
- **Luther's Two Kingdoms**
	- Faith and Salvation --> Spiritual/Inward Kingdom
	- State and Church --> Civic/Temporal/Outward Kingdom
- Paradigms:
	- Reason - faith
	- Law - gospel
	- Sinner - righteous
