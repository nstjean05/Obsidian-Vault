## Communicating Technical Competencies Beyond Grades
- Important to well communicate the problems you are working on, but don't inflate them
	- This may get you an interview, but you won't get past it
- *Clarity* and *credibility* are key
- Your grade is important to a point - have to be higher than the cutoff
- Reframe coursework as legitimate experience (articulate it properly)
	- ex. I took CMPT 231 --> I measured an analyzed the efficiency of several data structures.
