#### Pointer Types
- Also known as *access types* (Ada) or *reference types*
- These types are pointers to or logical addresses of an entity residing at that location. 
- They may be themselves types so that
	- `POINTER TO REAL` has its own type distinct from `POINTER TO CARDINAL`
	- Or all just of types `ADDRESS` (or compatible with it)
- They have values in an abstract range of memory location
	- These are only connected to and not identical with machine addresses.
- They have a specific value, `NIL`, `nul`, or some similar name that points nowhere.
- They reference a particular type of data at that address
	- Where an appropriate amount of memory for the data is reserved heap-dynamically.
- They are not themselves structured types because they only have one component themselves - a virtual address.
	- What they point to is not a component of themselves.
	- So if `myPoint` is a pointer or reference to memory `myPoint` is an address of a location, a reference `myPointA` or `*myPoint` or `myPoint.` is the actual data.
#### Design Issues for Pointers
- Is the data type checked on assignment
	- e.g. If `p` is a pointer to an integer can you do `*p = 2.5` (or `p^ := 2.5`)?
	- And if so, what happens? Compiler error?
- What is their scope and lifetime?
	- The same rules as any other variable, or...
- Are dangling references (pointers whose memory is gone) and garbage (heap memory with no pointers) collected or allowed to accumulate?
- Are aliases (two pointers to the same memory) allowed?
- Are they used for other referencing?
	- Passing reference parameters objects?
	- Automatically or manually?
- How is the memory to which they point allocated? deallocated?
	- Auto or manual?
	- e.g. in C++ both are manual, but in Java they're automatic.
- Is nil, nul, NIL a reserved word or a standard identifier?
- Are pointers set to NUL on creation (i.e. automatic at declaration)
	- Failed allocation of memory
	- Deallocation
- What is their syntax and semantics?
