## Muhammad's Passing and Succession
- Islam, by Muhammad's death (632 A.D.), had spread throughout Saudi Arabia and Northern Oman/Yemen
- Muhammad's friend and father-in-law, Abu Bakr, became his successor (caliph)
- The **caliph** governed in accordance with Muslim law as defined by the Quran
- Abu Bakr was voted in, since he was mature, rather than the 18-year-old son in law Ali
1. Abu Bakr, 632-634
	- Spread to the complete Arabian peninsula
2. 'Umar, 634-644
	- Ali is still only 20, not determined to be old enough
	- Spread the southern Mediterranean until Western Libya, North to Georgia, and East over Iran
	- Transcription of the Quran
	- Organized the government and currency, as he was an excellent administrator
3. 'Uthman, 644-656
	- When chosen, he was a new Muslim, had not known Muhammad, and was highly corrupt
	- Decided to move from Mecca to Baghdad for better weather
4. Ali
	- This is where we have the split
	- The Shia (meaning 'party') accept him, but the Sunnis do not accept the Caliphate
	- Shia believe that the successor must be a direct descendent of the prophet Muhammad
## The 12 Imams
- The infallibility assigned to the 12 Shi'ite Imams closely parallels the proclaimed by Pope Pius the IX in 1870
- If the Ayatollah tells someone to do something, then they cannot be wrong, and you should absolutely do that thing
	- Sunni tradition has legal laws, whereas in Shia the Imams make the laws
	- Ex. In Iran, if the Mullahs say to "go kill the protesters",  then there is not even a court case about whether it was right to kill them.
