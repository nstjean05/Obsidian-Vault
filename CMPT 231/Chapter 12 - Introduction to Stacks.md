## Collection Terminology
- A *collection* is an object that holds and organizes other objects.
	- They provide operations for accessing and managing those elements.
	- Many standardized collections have been defined over time.
- Some collections are *linear* in nature, whereas others are *non-linear*.
	- **Linear:** Each element links to one more element, and has one element linked to it.
	- **Non-Linear**: Elements may link to more than one element.
	- Left: Linear, Right: Non-Linear

## Abstractions
- An abstraction hides details to make a concept easier to manage.
- All objects can be considered as abstractions, as they use an interface.
- This means that objects are generally great mechanisms for implementing collections.
###### Abstract Data Type
- A *data type* is a group of values and the operations defined on those values.
- An *abstract data type (ADT)* is a data type that isn't pre-defined in the language.
- A *data structure* is the set of programming constructs and techniques used to implement a collection.
- Sometimes the differences between these three ideas are blurred.
###### The Java Collections API
- The classes provided within Java are called the *Java Application Programming Interface* (API).
	- Those classes which support collections are called the *Java Collections API*.
