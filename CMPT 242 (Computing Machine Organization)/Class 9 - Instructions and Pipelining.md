## Instruction Tradeoffs
- Make all instructions the same length
	- Simple, but wastes space
- Make instructions vary in length per use
	- Efficient memory but heavier load on the CPU.
- **Examples** of typical instructions:
	- Load a counter in register 6
	- Load memory into register 225
	- Move memory to a different memory
	- Move register " " register
	- Add register 1 to register 2 and put answer in register 3 or in memory
