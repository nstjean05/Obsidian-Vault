## 3.1 - Introduction
- Examination of binary representations used by computers for data.
	- Integer
	- Characters
	- Floating Point
- Show the consequences of representing data in binary.
## 3.2 - Definitions Of Bit And Byte
- **Bit** - Short for *Binary Digit*
	- Can Have two possible values.
	- Often represented in hardware as two voltage levels.
		- High/low or true/false
	- Software engineers generally use 0/1
- **Byte** - String of eight bits
	- This is needed as bits are too small in most applications
	- A byte contains eight hardware units, each holding a bit
	- These units work in parallel, delivering all eight bytes at the same time, giving the appearance of a single piece of hardware.
## 3.3 - Possible Values In A Byte
- A decimal number with *k* digits can represent a range of 10$^k$ digits.
	- Each bit can represent 2 possible values.
	- A byte generally has 8 bits.
	- A byte can represent 2$^8$ = 256 values.
		- Range 0 to 255
- In general, a data item occupying *k* bits can represent 2$^k$ possible values.
- For example, with 3 bits, 2$^3$ = 8 possible combinations.
	- 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111
- A bit has no intrinsic meaning, it only gains it by its interpretation.
## 3.4 - Binary Weighted Positional Representation
- Remember how to use base 10 - each position represents a power of 10.
	- For example, 123 = (1 * 10$^2$) + (2 * 10$^1)$ + (3 * 10$^0$)
- In the binary system, each position represents a power of two.
	- Take the value *010101* or *111100*
	- 010101 = (0 * 2$^5$) + (1 * 2$^4$) + (0 * 2$^3$) + (1 * 2$^2$) + (0 * 2$^1$) + (1 * 2$^0$) = 21
	- 010101 = (1 * 2$^5$) + (1 * 2$^4$) + (1 * 2$^3$) + (1 * 2$^2$) + (0 * 2$^1$) + (0 * 2$^0$) = 60
- The binary numbers that can be represented with eight bits range 0 to 255.
- Modern hardware usually supports 32- and 64-bits (4 and 8 bytes respectively).
- Below shows the common powers of two in decimal values.

## 3.5 - Bit Ordering
- In **decimal**, the least significant digit is on the right, with the most on the left.
- In **binary**, the *Least Significant Bit* (LSB) is on the right, and the *Most Significant Bit* (MSB) is on the left..
- This system of left and right doesn't make as much sense in relation to physical hardware.
- **Bit ordering** becomes especially important when bits locations are transferred, as the same order must be preserved
## 3.6 - Hexadecimal Notation Used By Humans
- Numeric values can be written in decimal, but this does not specify the individual bit-values.
- For this, we can use base-16, a.k.a. hexadecimal.
- **Hexadecimal** encodes each group of four bits (a *nibble*) into a single **hex** digit.
- Languages use letters *A - F* (representing 9 - 15) to the set of decimal digits.

- Here is an example of how a binary string corresponds to hex

## 3.7 - Notation For Hexadecimal And Binary Constants
- Since a number can have ambiguous value when using different bases, mathematicians use subscripts to denote when a value isn't base 10.
	- For example, 125$_1$$_6$ denotes hexadecimal.
	- 125$_1$$_6$ = (1 * 16$^2$ ) + (2* 16$^1$ ) + (5 * 16$^0$ ) = 293$_1$$_0$
	- 293$_1$$_0$ = $\frac{293}{16}$ = 18 remainder 5, digit 0.
			$\frac{18}{16}$ = 1 remainder 2, digit 2.
			$\frac{1}{16}$ = 0 remainder 1, digit 3.
		- 293$_1$$_0$ = 125$_1$$_6$
- Depending on the base, there may also be a prefix.
	- **Hex**: 0x
	- **Binary**: 0b
- So to specify the 32-bit value in section 3.6, we would write **0xDEC90949**
## 3.8 - Character Sets
- Although a string of bits have no inherent meaning, there are standardized meanings for things like characters.
	- 1960s, IBM created EBCDIC, one of the first standardized character sets.
	- 1963, ASCII became a standard used across manufacturers, created by ANSI.
		- 128 characters, and additional bytes for symbols (escape, del, etc.)
		- Only seven bits are needed to represent an ASCII character.
		- There could be a max of 255 values, but only 128 leaves room for unconventional customization by programmers.
		- Below are the 128 characters, with their ASCII counterpart.

## 3.9 - Unicode
- Some languages have many more characters than most European languages.
	- To accommodate this, there are some extensions and alternate methods of representing characters.
- **Unicode** is a standard for extended character sets.
	- It extends ASCII, and is intended to make character sets possible for all languages.
	- The current unicode standard defines ~150,000 symbols, including emojis.
## 3.11 - Signed Binary Integers
- A signed number means that it is positive or negative.
- There are 3 representations for *signed integers*:
	- **Sign Magnitude**: For an int of *k* bits, the most significant bit is interpreted as the sign (1 if the number is negative, otherwise 0). The remaining *k - 1* bits are the unsigned integer that specifies the absolute value.
	- **One's Complement**: A positive integer uses the same positional representation as an unsigned integer, making the maximum value of a k-bit integer (2$^k$$^-$$^1$ - 1), since the most significant digit is 0. To form the negative:
		- Flip each bit of the positive number.
	- **Two's Complement**: A k-bit two's complement integer uses the same positional representation as an unsigned int, with exception that the most significant bit has the value -2$^k$. To form the negative:
		- Take the positive binary value.
		- Flip each bit.
		- Add 1.
		- For example, take 010101.
		- Since the high-order bit = 0, the two's complement value is 21, the same as the unsigned value.
		- 010101 = (0 * -2$^5$) + (1 * 2$^4$) + (0 * 2$^3$) + (1 * 2$^2$) + (0 * 2$^1$) + (1 * 2$^0$) = 21
		- Another example, take 111100.
		- 111100 = (1 * -2$^5$) + (1 * 2$^4$) + (1 * 2$^3$) + (1 * 2$^2$) + (0 * 2$^1$) + (0 * 2$^0$) = -4
## 3.12 - Quirks of Signed Representations
- There are many oddities that result from signs.
	- Sign-Magnitude makes it possible to create the value of -0.
	- One's complement allows for two inverted values of zero (0000, 1111)
	- Two's complement includes one more negative value that positive.
## 3.13 - Example Of Two's Complement Numbers
- Below is a chart of nibbles and their various signed interpretations.
- Two's complement is the only one that doesn't have two zeroes.
![[Pasted image 20250916155525.png]]
- Unsigned and two's complement can use the same hardware operations for either representation.
## 3.14 - Sign Extension
- Computers support integers of various sizes (8, 16, 32, 64-bit, etc.)
- Occasionally a smaller value must be reassigned to a bigger one.
	- Ex. an *int* to a *long*
- In this case, the hardware must make the number 'longer' to fill the extra space.
- **Sign Extension** allows us to promote from *k-bits* to a larger size in 2's complement.
- Two examples:
	- **4-bit:** 1010      **8-bit:** 11111010
	- **16-bit:** 0000 0000 0000 0001      **32-bit**:0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
- Determine if the first digit is 1 or 0 (negative or positive), and then paste that number throughout the high-order bits.
- A computer can use a single hardware circuit to perform both unsigned and twoâ€™s complement integer arithmetic; software running on the computer can choose an interpretation for the resulting bit strings.
