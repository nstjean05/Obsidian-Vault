**7.**  _begin processors  Chapter 4_

a. **# 22.4,  22.9,  22.11**

b. Write a program that will print out a neat table of the ASCII characters from 0-127. NOTE: 0-31 and 127 are special ones that do not print per se, so print their names instead (e.g. cr. lf, bel.… )


**22.4** Write a truth table for the full adder circuit in Figure 22.12.


**22.9** If a decoder chip has five input pins (not counting power and ground), how many output pins will it have?


**22.11** Assume a circuit has a spare _nor_ gate. Can any useful functions be created by connecting one of the inputs to logical one? To logical zero? Explain.
