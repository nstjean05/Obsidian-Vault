# Long COVID Prediction: Machine Learning Analysis Results

  

## Overview

This folder contains all Python scripts, trained models, and analysis results for the BIOT470/CMPT470 project on predicting pulmonary long COVID outcomes using immunological biomarkers.

  

> [!INFO] **Project Goal**

> Demonstrate that acute-phase immunological biomarkers can predict pulmonary long COVID development, validating the hypothesis that immune dysregulation (not basic demographics) drives disease progression.

## 🔄 Complete Data Processing & Modeling Pipeline

  

### Step-by-Step Process (Beginner Guide)
#### **STEP 1: Data Loading & Exploration**

```

Raw Excel Files (Sheet1.xlsx, Sheet2.xlsx)

↓

pandas.read_excel()

↓

Inspect data shape, types, missing values

```

  

**What happens:**

- Load biomarker data (Sheet1): 185 samples × 7,431 columns

- Load clinical data (Sheet2): 81 samples × 15 columns

- Examine first few rows and data types

  

**Code location:** Lines 30-50 in all scripts

  

---

  

#### **STEP 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

  

> [!WARNING] **Most Critical Step!**

> Raw data often has problems that can cause models to fail or produce incorrect results. Proper cleaning is essential.

  

```

Raw Data

↓

[PROBLEM 1] Remove metadata columns

- Patient IDs, cluster labels, censoring flags that aren't predictive features

- Keep only biomarker measurements

↓

[PROBLEM 2] Handle non-numeric values

- Replace string "NaN;", "NaN", empty values with actual NaN

- Convert all features to float/numeric type

↓

[PROBLEM 3] Handle missing values (NaN)

- Fill with median value of that feature

- Median is used because it's robust to outliers

↓

Clean, numeric feature matrix (X)

```

  

> [!TIP] **Why Use Median?**

> Median is robust to outliers (unlike mean). If one biomarker value is 1000× normal due to measurement error, the median won't be affected.

  

**Real example from the data:**

```python

# BEFORE cleaning:

"x1_Cytokine_IL6": [0, "NaN;", 2.5, "", 1.8, None]

  

# AFTER cleaning:

"x1_Cytokine_IL6": [0.0, 1.1, 2.5, 1.1, 1.8, 1.1]

↑ filled with median

```

  

**Code location:** Lines 60-90 in all scripts, using:

- `df[col].replace(['NaN;', 'NaN', ''], np.nan)`

- `X[col].fillna(X[col].median())`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 3: Feature Selection**

```

7,431 raw columns

↓

Remove non-numeric columns (dates, text)

↓

Keep features with >50% valid data

(discard features that are 50% empty)

↓

7,403 clean biomarker features

```

  

**Why this matters:**

- Models can only process numbers

- Features that are mostly empty don't help predictions

- Reducing to 7,403 useful features keeps computation reasonable

  

**Code location:** Lines 85-100 in scripts, filtering with `pd.to_numeric()` and `conversion_rate > 0.5`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 4: Create Target Variable (What We're Predicting)**

```

Raw outcome variable: 0, 1, 2 (different censoring statuses)

↓

Convert to BINARY (0 or 1):

- 0 = No Long COVID

- 1 = Has Long COVID (combines original 1 and 2)

↓

Balanced classification problem

```

  

**Code location:** Lines 105-110: `y_binary = (y > 0).astype(int)`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 5: Handle Class Imbalance**

```

Raw data:

- 178 No Long COVID cases

- 7 Long COVID cases (SEVERELY IMBALANCED!)

↓

Problem: Model might learn to just predict "No Long COVID" always

and get 96% accuracy while being useless!

↓

Solution: SPLIT into train/test BEFORE applying fix

↓

Training split:

- 148 No Long COVID

- 6 Long COVID

↓

Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):

- Generate 142 synthetic Long COVID samples

- ONLY done on training data (never test data)

- Creates realistic synthetic examples by averaging similar real samples

↓

Balanced training set (284 total):

- 142 No Long COVID

- 142 Long COVID ✓

↓

Test split:

- Keep original 36 No Long COVID

- Keep original 1 Long COVID

(Never modify test data!)

```

  

> [!DANGER] **Critical: SMOTE Only on Training Data**

> SMOTE must NEVER be applied to test data. This prevents "data leakage" where test data influences model training. Always split first, then apply SMOTE only to training set.

  

**Why SMOTE is applied only to training:**

- Prevents data leakage (test data stays pure)

- Gives model balanced examples to learn from

- Ensures reliable test performance metrics

  

**Code location:** Lines 120-135: `SMOTE(random_state=42)`, applied only to `X_train_smote`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 6: Feature Scaling (For Logistic Regression)**

```

Not all features have the same scale:

- Age: 20-80

- Cortisol: 0.1-500

- CD8+ T cells: 0-1000

↓

Problem: Large-scale features dominate logistic regression

↓

Standardize (Z-score normalization):

- Subtract mean, divide by standard deviation

- Transform any value to mean=0, std=1

↓

Feature 1: [20, 30, 40] → [-1.5, 0, 1.5]

Feature 2: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0] → [-1.2, 0.3, 1.2]

```

  

**Use:** StandardScaler only applied to data for Logistic Regression, not trees

  

**Code location:** Lines 140-145: `StandardScaler().fit_transform()`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 7: Train-Test Split**

```

All 185 samples

↓

80/20 split (stratified):

↓

Training (80%) Test (20%)

148 samples 37 samples

6 Long COVID cases 1 Long COVID case

↓

Models ONLY see training data during learning

Test data held completely separate for evaluation

```

  

**Why stratified:** Keeps Long COVID ratio same (3.8%) in both splits

  

**Code location:** Lines 115-120: `train_test_split(..., stratify=y)`

  

---

  

#### **STEP 8: Model Training**

```

Training data (284 samples × 7,403 features)

↓

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ RANDOM FOREST (200 trees) │

│ - Each tree learns different patterns │

│ - Vote on final prediction │

│ - Handles high dimensions well │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

↓

Trained Model 1 (stored in memory)

  

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ GRADIENT BOOSTING (150 trees) │

│ - Each tree corrects previous errors │

│ - Sequential refinement │

│ - Can overfit if not careful │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

↓

Trained Model 2 (stored in memory)

  

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ LOGISTIC REGRESSION │

│ - Linear model (simpler/interpretable) │

│ - Assigns weights to each feature │

│ - Converts output to probability │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

↓

Trained Model 3 (stored in memory)

```

  

**Code location:** Lines 155-220 in comprehensive_model_analysis.py

  

---

  

#### **STEP 9: Model Evaluation**

```

Test data (37 samples × 7,403 features)

↓

Feed to each trained model

↓

Get predictions: [No COVID, COVID, No COVID, ...]

Get probabilities: [0.1, 0.9, 0.2, ...]

↓

Compare to actual outcomes

↓

Calculate metrics:

• Accuracy: % correct

• ROC-AUC: probability ranking quality

• Precision: when predicting COVID, how often right?

• Recall: catching all actual COVID cases?

• F1-Score: balance between precision/recall

↓

Results table (model_comparison_results.csv)

```

  

**Code location:** Lines 225-280

  

---

  

### **STEP 10: Feature Importance Analysis**

```

Trained model learned:

"This feature matters a lot" (importance: 0.012)

"This feature matters less" (importance: 0.002)

"This feature doesn't matter" (importance: 0.0001)

↓

Extract importance scores

↓

Rank features by importance

Top biomarkers:

1. HSV1 immune signature: 0.0126

2. CCL8 chemokine: 0.0113

3. CCL2 chemokine: 0.0097

...

↓

Output: *_feature_importance.csv files

```

  

**Interpretation:**

- Random Forest: % of splits using that feature

- Gradient Boosting: improvement from using that feature

- Logistic Regression: coefficient magnitude (weight on feature)

## 🤖 Trained Models: Storage & Reusability

  

### Where Are Models Stored?

  

> [!INFO] **Current State: In-Memory Only**

> Models exist only while scripts run. After execution ends, they are deleted from RAM and cannot be reused unless resaved to disk.

  

**After Script Runs:**

```

During execution: Models loaded into RAM ✓

After script ends: Models deleted from RAM ✗

```

  

### Option 1: Save Models to Disk (For Reuse)

  

> [!SUCCESS] **Recommended for Production**

> Save models using `joblib` to reuse them later without retraining.

  

To reuse models on new data, save them using `pickle` or `joblib`:

  

```python

# At end of comprehensive_model_analysis.py, add:

import joblib

  

# Save trained models

joblib.dump(rf_model, 'trained_rf_model.pkl')

joblib.dump(gb_model, 'trained_gb_model.pkl')

joblib.dump(lr_model, 'trained_lr_model.pkl')

  

# Save preprocessor

joblib.dump(scaler, 'feature_scaler.pkl')

```

  

**Later, load and reuse on new data:**

```python

import joblib

import pandas as pd

  

# Load saved models

rf_model = joblib.load('trained_rf_model.pkl')

scaler = joblib.load('feature_scaler.pkl')

  

# Load new data

new_data = pd.read_excel("new_patients.xlsx")

  

# Preprocess new data same way as training

new_data_clean = preprocess(new_data) # same steps as before

  

# Make predictions

predictions = rf_model.predict(new_data_clean)

probabilities = rf_model.predict_proba(new_data_clean)[:, 1]

  

print(predictions) # [0, 1, 0, 1, ...]

```

  

### Option 2: Cross-Validate on Training Data Only

Instead of saving models, use 5-fold cross-validation:

```

Split training data into 5 folds

├─ Fold 1: Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold

├─ Fold 2: Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold

├─ Fold 3: Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold

├─ Fold 4: Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold

└─ Fold 5: Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold

↓

Average performance across all 5 runs

Result: Robust estimate without saving models

```

  

**This is what we did:** `cross_val_score()` in all scripts

  

---

  

## 📊 Can You Use These Models on Other Datasets?

  

### YES, BUT with Important Caveats:

  

#### **CASE 1: NEW PATIENTS, SAME BIOMARKERS** ✅ (Good)

```

Your trained Random Forest model:

Expects: 7,403 immunological biomarkers

Outputs: Long COVID probability

↓

New dataset with same 7,403 biomarkers?

✓ Can use model (after same preprocessing)

↓

Preprocessing checklist:

☑ Load data

☑ Remove metadata columns

☑ Convert to numeric

☑ Fill missing values (use MEDIAN from training data, not new data!)

☑ Apply to model: predictions = model.predict(new_data)

```

  

> [!DANGER] **Critical: Use Training Data Statistics**

> Always use mean/median from TRAINING data to fill new data missing values. Never compute new statistics from test or new data. This prevents data leakage.

  

---

  

#### **CASE 2: DIFFERENT DISEASE / OUTCOME** ⚠️ (Risky)

> [!WARNING] **Not Recommended**

> Reusing models for different outcomes (e.g., cardiac long COVID instead of pulmonary) risks poor performance or false confidence.

```

Your model trained on: Long COVID prediction

You want to predict: Other post-COVID complications (cardiac, neuro, GI)

↓

Problem: Model learned patterns specific to PULMONARY Long COVID

↓

What could happen:

• Predictions might be poor (patterns don't transfer)

• Or accidentally give false confidence

↓

Should you do it anyway?

✗ Not recommended without retraining

✓ Could use as starting point for transfer learning

```

  

---

  

#### **CASE 3: DIFFERENT BIOMARKERS / FEATURES** ❌ (Won't work)

> [!FAILURE] **Incompatible**

> Models expect exactly 7,403 features. Different biomarker sets cause feature mismatch errors. Must retrain or manually select to match.

  

```

Your model expects: 7,403 features

New data has: Different biomarkers, different counts

↓

Error: Feature mismatch!

↓

You must:

✗ Cannot use model directly

✓ Retrain model on new features

✓ Or manually select/subset to match original 7,403 features

```

  

---

  

#### **CASE 4: SMALLER DATASET** ⚠️ (Needs validation)

> [!CAUTION] **Requires Validation**

> Smaller datasets may show reduced accuracy. Always validate performance and consider retraining if metrics drop significantly.

  

```

Your model trained on: 185 patients

New data has: 30 patients

↓

Concerns:

• Fewer samples = less reliable predictions

• Model might be overfit to original data

• External validation important

↓

Best practice:

✓ Test model performance on new 30 patients

✓ If accuracy drops significantly, retrain

✓ Use cross-validation instead of single train-test split

```

  

---

  

## 📋 Complete Data Processing Checklist

  

Use this when applying models to new datasets:

  

```

NEW DATASET WORKFLOW:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  

1. DATA LOADING

☐ Load Excel/CSV file with pandas

☐ Inspect shape (n rows, n columns)

☐ Check for expected biomarkers present

2. COLUMN IDENTIFICATION

☐ Identify outcome column (Long COVID yes/no)

☐ Remove metadata (IDs, dates, text descriptions)

☐ List remaining biomarker columns

3. DATA TYPE CONVERSION

☐ Replace "NaN;", "NaN", "", None with np.nan

☐ Convert all feature columns to numeric

☐ Check data types: should be float64

4. HANDLE MISSING VALUES

☐ Calculate median of EACH feature on TRAINING DATA ONLY

☐ Fill new data missing values with training medians

☐ Exception: If feature new data has ALL missing, skip it

5. CREATE BINARY OUTCOME

☐ Convert outcome to 0/1 (No COVID / COVID)

☐ Check class balance in new data

☐ If highly imbalanced (<5% positive), expect overconfidence

6. FEATURE SCALING (Logistic Regression only)

☐ Use training set StandardScaler (already fit)

☐ Transform new data: X_new_scaled = scaler.transform(X_new)

☐ Never fit scaler to test/new data!

7. MAKE PREDICTIONS

☐ Load trained model: rf_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

☐ Call: predictions = rf_model.predict(X_new)

☐ Call: probabilities = rf_model.predict_proba(X_new)[:, 1]

☐ Output: Prediction (0 or 1) and probability (0.0 to 1.0)

8. VALIDATE RESULTS

☐ Do predictions make biological sense?

☐ Are uncertainties reasonable?

☐ If possible, compare to actual outcomes (calculate accuracy)

☐ If accuracy < 70%, model may not generalize

```
