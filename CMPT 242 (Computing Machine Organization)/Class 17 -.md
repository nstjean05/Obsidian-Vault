a. What is "virtual memory" and how is it used?

b. What is "thrashing" and how can it be cured?

c. You have a null-terminated string of printable 8-bit characters (i.e. ending in a stored value of $00) stored starting at memory location $A000. A character out routine is located at a memory location named by the constant COUT. Write code in assembler to output this string. Revise it if instead the _address_ of the string starting location is stored at memory $A000.
