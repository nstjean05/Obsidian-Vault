## Quantifying Uncertainty
- In the approach thus far, we have had limited observability and/or non-determinism
	- Belief states which can capture all possible world states.
	- As representations become larger, the probability that there is no path which guarantees the goal grows.
	- Agents must still act.
- Rationality now depends on importance of the goal, and odds of reaching it.
- For example, use a medical diagnosis to show the insufficiency of logic.
	- People are lazy, so they may not follow the most logical course.
