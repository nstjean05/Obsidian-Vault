# Early Christianity
1. Second Century
	- Christianity was urban, somewhat unlike today
	- Rome's roads and empire helped facilitate the early spread of Christianity
2. Four important urban centres
	- Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria
	- Paul made four early missionary journeys
		- He often visited the synagogues upon entering a new city
	- The early church was highly multicultural and had a diverse composition of thought
## Christianity in a Hellenistic Context
1. It becomes illegal
	- Romans saw Christians as weird Jews
	- Once they became distinct from Judaism, issues arose
2. As Christianity expands, it needed to better articulate its methods
	- Leads to development in theology
3. The gospel
## Hellenistic Contexts
- Religious
	- Polytheism/Pluralism
- Theological & Philosophical
	- Platonists
		- The divine/God was essentially a super-mind
		- An absolute, unchanging, spiritual being
		- Static perfection
	- Aristotelians
	- Stoics
## Two Scandals of Christ
### Christ is Lord
- There is only one God, and only that God should be worshipped
- Mutually exclusive with the worship of other gods
- This conflicts with their pantheon and ideas of polytheism
### God Incarnate
- Incarnate = In the flesh
- This clashes with Platonism, as God was seen as the opposite of a human being - eternal, metaphysical, ineffable
# Christianity and Rome
## Christianity in the Shadows
- It begins on the edge of Rome's empire in small Jewish groups
- Christians generally liked Rome
	- They didn't want to be persecuted, but the empire provided immense social stability
	- Roman citizenship was prized
	- Self-described exemplary Roman citizens
		- Served in the armies
	- Romans 13:1-5
		- Be subject to the governing authorities
	- 1 Peter 2:13-17
		- Fear God, honour the emperor.
	- Acts 5:27-32
		- Peter is told by the Romans not to preach the gospel
		- He responds saying that they must obey God, not humans
- Apologists
	- Offered a defense, explaining why Christians were not detrimental to the empire
	- Said that they could not worship the emperor cult
- Engagement and Integration
	- Would use Roman philosophical contexts
	- Follow the pattern of Roman governmental buildings
## Christianity becomes Public
- Rising vulnerability
	- Once a minority group gets on the radar of the majorities, they can become a problem
