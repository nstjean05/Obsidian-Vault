- *The Haram* - The Forbidden Triangle
	- Within the borders of Mecca, Medina, and Bedr
	- No wars, weapons, etc. allowed in this holy region
- *Jahiliyyah*
	- Arabic for *ignorance*
	- When you existed in the time of jahiliyyah, you lived before having the revelation from God, and are therefore not bound by the law.

	2. Nile route: Alexandria --> Red sea --> around Yemen/Oman --> India/China

- It was very dangerous in the region of Arabia, so attempts to Christianize it were rare and failing
- Locals built cisterns throughout Arabia which collected water during rain, allowing caravans to get water.
	- There used a mix of Arabic/Sabean on signs so that outsiders couldn't read it and find the water
## Pre-Islamic Life
- Early pre-Islamic civilisations occurred around 1,000–2,000 BC.
	- One example of this was the Bedouins, who regularly voted in their wisest as a leader, calling them the *sheikh*
- However, there were no stable, large political entities
- Small minorities of Jews and Christians were scattered
- Most daily activities were done at night, since it is so hot during the day.
	- Daily life was harsh
	- Lots of afternoon leisure time
		- Couldn't sleep like some other cultures (such as a siesta in Mexico), since it was too dangerous around.
	- This led to great development of music, literature, and storytelling
- Led to learning about the stars and moon, as most walking was done at night.
