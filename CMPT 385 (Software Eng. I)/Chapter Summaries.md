# Ch. 2 – Process Models
- Process Models --> Framework of activities actions, and work tasks.
	- Various models have different flows, organized sequentially or chronologically.
	- These patterns are useful for solving common software process challenges.
### Prescriptive Models
- Bring order and structure to software development.
- Vary, but have the same framework of generic activities.
	- Communication
	- Planning
	- Modelling
	- Construction
#### Sequential
- Older paradigms such as the waterfall model.
	- Communication > Planning > Modelling > Construction > Deployment
	- Each can only begin when the prior is complete.
- Linear process flow
	- Often inconsistent with reality.
#### Incremental
- Iterative in nature, and quickly produce a working version of software
- Includes the prototyping and spiral model.
- **Prototyping Model**
