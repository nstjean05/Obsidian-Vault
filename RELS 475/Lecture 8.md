# Early Christianity
1. Second Century
	- Christianity was urban, somewhat unlike today
	- Rome's roads and empire helped facilitate the early spread of Christianity
2. Four important urban centres
	- Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria
	- Paul made four early missionary journeys
		- He often visited the synagogues upon entering a new city
	- The early church was highly multicultural and had a diverse composition of thought
## Christianity in a Hellenistic Context
1. It becomes illegal
	- Romans saw Christians as weird Jews
	- Once they became distinct from Judaism, issues arose
2. As Christianity expands, it needed to better articulate its methods
	- Leads to development in theology
3. The gospel
## Hellenistic Contexts
- Religious
	- Polytheism/Pluralism
- Theological & Philosophical
	- Platonists
		- The divine/God was essentially a super-mind
		- An absolute, unchanging, spiritual being
		- Static perfection
	- Aristotelians
	- Stoics
## Two Scandals of Christ
### Christ is Lord
- There is only one God, and only that God should be worshipped
- Mutually exclusive with the worship of other gods
- This conflicts with their pantheon and ideas of polytheism
### God Incarnate
- Incarnate = In the flesh
- This clashes with Platonism, as God was seen as the opposite of a human being - eternal, metaphysical, ineffable
# Christianity and Rome
## Christianity in the Shadows
- It begins on the edge of Rome's empire in small Jewish groups
- Christians generally liked Rome
	- They didn't want to be persecuted, but the empire provided immense social stability
	- Roman citizenship was prized
	- Self-described exemplary Roman citizens
		- Served in the armies
	- Romans 13:1-5
		- Be subject to the governing authorities
	- 1 Peter 2:13-17
		- Fear God, honour the emperor.
	- Acts 5:27-32
		- Peter is told by the Romans not to preach the gospel
		- He responds saying that they must obey God, not humans
- Apologists
	- Offered a defense, explaining why Christians were not detrimental to the empire
	- Said that they could not worship the emperor cult
- Engagement and Integration
	- Would use Roman philosophical contexts
	- Follow the pattern of Roman governmental buildings
## Christianity Goes Public
- Rising vulnerability
	- Once a minority group gets on the radar of the majorities, they can become a problem
- They became subject to persecution
## Christians, Empire, and Civil Disobedience
1. The emperor cult
	- Had to please the gods for things in the empire to go well
	- Sacrifices to images of the emperor made across the empire
	- The *Genius of the Emperor*
		- The gods would be represented through the emperor
2. Social Subversion
	- Not sacrificing to the emperor led to social subversion
	- When things began to go poorly for the empire, the Christians not worshipping were to blame
	- This was not an issue for non-Romans
3. Roman Responses
	- Christian persecution wasn't usually empire wide; it would break out in a region
	- **Decian Persecution** (250 A.D.)
4. Diocletian Persecution (303-313 A.D.)
	- Ended by the Edict of Milan in 313
	- Christians had a variety of responses, from apostatizing to martyrdom
- Many questions are a result
	- Does God bless certain nations because of their religions?
	- Does God bless nations that are more moral than others?
	- Are sides picked?
# Christendom and Monasticism
- **Christendom** is a civilization in which a) Christianity is the dominant religion and b) that dominance has been backed up by social/legal compulsions
- The idea of Christendom has historically been linked with the explicit vision of the church to play an important role in nation building
	- Ex. Canada and many Western nations
- Should the church work through the government to see Christian values enforced in the government?
## Constantines Conversion
- Christians were disenfranchised
- Constantine comes to power
	- Wins a great battle, claims it was God's will
- Emergence of Christendom
- Christian on Christian persecution
	- Christians in Persia are on the 'wrong team' from a Roman POV
- Religious coercion
	- Ex. Charlemagne and the Germanic conquest
- Price of patronage
	- If the emperor is now
