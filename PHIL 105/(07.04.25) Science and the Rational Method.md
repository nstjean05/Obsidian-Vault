# The Hume Induction
- Scepticism - We know a lot less than we think we do.
- We assume that we know a lot of things, which we have not observed.
	- Ex. Most people believe that the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, although not many have seen them.
- How do we determine that something unobserved is true?
- We can prove that any triangle will have angles adding to 180*.
	- This is a **necessary truth**.
		- These are claims that must be true.
		- Gathering evidence is not necessary.
		- Known as a *relation of ideas* or the *operation of thought*
- **Matters of Fact** are truths which are true, but disagreeing with it is not inconceivable.
	- For example I have a small dog, but it is not impossible to think that I might be lying about that.
- **Kant**
	- A Posteriori - Matters of Fact
	- A Priori - Relations of Ideas.
# Hume's Skepticism
- How can we know about matters of fact which are neither determined by observation, nor operation of thought.
	- **Observed Regularities**: Because all of something has x quality, then we assume that the next of something will also have that quality.
		- All fires I've touched have been hot, so that fire over there is also hot.
		- This argument uses induction.
		- However, sometimes this is not a good argument, as things can change their qualities.
			- Each of the hairs on my head are orange, so when the next hair grows it will also be orange. Yet when I get old, this may not be so.
		- We may rely on induction when making general inferences about our environment.
