## The Modern Era (Contd.)
#### I Language Extensions, Alterations (3)
30. Object Pascal (Wirth, for Apple OS X early versions)
31. Objective C (Became another Apple project)
32. Scheme (MIT: Abelson and Sussman - from Lisp)
#### Newer Languages
36. Java (Sun Microsystems)
	- Almost pure OO, excep primitive (built-in) types most code parts of objects.
	- Does garbage collection
	- No standalone subprograms; no true pointers
	- Borrows syntax, look, and feel from C/C++
	- Ideas from Pascal, Modula-2, and Smalltalk
	- Compiles to a Java Virtual machine
	- Never standardized, so don't assume portability
	- J++ is the MS version
37. JavaScript (Standardized as EcmaScript)
	- A net scripting language, runs client side in browsers
	- With Ajax can do dynamic loading into static pages, which can result in very fast loads.
38. PHP
	- A net scripting language that runs server-side
	- Used with databases; MySQL querying capabilities
	- Integral part of LAMP environments
		- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
39. Perl
	- Scripting language; extensive string manipulation capabilities
40. C# (Microsoft)
	- An attempt to replace Java with an MS propietary language; similar design
	- V 13.0 runs in .NET 9.0
41. Python
	- A compiled/interpreted multipurpose OO language
	- Descended from Modula-2 but looks more like C
	- Most popular language for beginners; easy to learn
	- Competes against JavaScript
	- Data science, machine learning, computer vision, image processing, game development, AI
	- Standard is de-facto, not de-jure
42. Ruby
	- Dynamic typing, extensible
	- Syntax similar to Eiffel and Ada
	- Pure OO language
	- Uses the 'Rails' environment
	- Used in conjunction with JavaScript
	- Now sometimes standalone (not in Apache)
## The Latest & Going Forward
#### 2010-2025 Projects (2)
43. Swift (Apple; released June 2014)
	- From Objective-C
	- Apple ecosystem programming; not general-purpose
	- Has a visual "playground"
	- Goals of safety, security, and extensibility
	- Has modules
	- Has something of an unfinished air to it
44. MODULA-2 R10 (Design begun 2010, abandoned 2022)
	- Sutcliffe & Kowarsch
	- From Classic Modula-2, not ISO, GM, or Modula-3
	- General purpose notation
	- Goals of safety, security, reliability, extensibility
	- Templates for generics, blueprints for ADTs
	- Small, very powerful, extensive library system
	- Incorporates latest ideas and design principles
	- built-in I/O procedures became Wirthian macros that are translated at compile time
45. Rust
	- Designed for safe concurrency
	- Syntactically similar to C++
	- Uses a checker to validate references; memory safe
	- Used by Dropbox
46. TypeScript
	- By MS as a JavaScript substitute; used by Google
	- Used for Angular2 + Spa, Vue.js



















**5. Â _Language History (part 2)_  
[3] a. Are there any logic programming languages other than Prolog? If yes, what?  

[3] b. Explain two reasons why pure interpretation is an acceptable implementation method for several recent scripting languages.  

[3] c. Give a brief general description of a markup-programming hybrid language.  

[3] d. Give a brief general description of a language other than anything mentioned here in these assignments or in the lecture.
