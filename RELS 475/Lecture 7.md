## Jesus and the Samaritan
- John 4:1-30
- There are several primary reasons why the Samaritan woman should have been an untouchable to Jesus.
	- Religious
		- Samaritans were seen to be of a different religion than Jews, and a corrupted one.
		- Worshipped on the mountaintops rather than in Jerusalem
		- John 4:20-21
	- Gender
		- She was a woman, and in this time/place men and woman would not have spoken to one another in public
	- Moral
		- Had 5 husbands, and was currently with someone who wasn't any of them
	- Race
		- Samaritans, native to Israel, had intermarried with other groups (ex. the Edomites) after the Assyrian invasion
## The Powers
- Colossians 1:15-20, 2:13-15
- Romans 8:19-22
- 1 Corinthians 2:6-8
- Ephesians 6:10-17
- There is repeated reference to '*powers*' in these texts
- The cross may be viewed as a triumph, as the cross could not hold Him back
	- Jesus' endurance after death
	- The *powers* couldn't deter Him from His mission
