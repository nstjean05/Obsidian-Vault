- A multi-way search tree combines the concepts of:
	- General trees, with multiple children per node.
	- BSTs, with relationships among elements but only 2 trees per node.
	- In multi-way search trees, each node may have more than 2 children, with a specific relationship between the elements.
### 2-3 Trees
- In a 2-3 tree, each node has 2 or 3 children.
- **2-Node**
	- Contains one element
	- Can have 2 or no children.
- **3-Node**
	- Contains two elements.
	- Can have 3 or no children.
