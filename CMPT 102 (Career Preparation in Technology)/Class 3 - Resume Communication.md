## Communicating Technical Competencies Beyond Grades
- Important to well communicate the problems you are working on, but don't inflate them
	- This may get you an interview, but you won't get past it
- *Clarity* and *credibility* are key
- Your grade is important to a point - have to be higher than the cutoff
- Reframe coursework as legitimate experience (articulate it properly)
	- ex. I took CMPT 231 --> I measured an analyzed the efficiency of several data structures.
#### STAR Storytelling Framework
1. Situation - 20% - Explain the situation and context of your example.
2. Task - 10% - Talk about the task, problem or challenge you were responsible for.
3. Action - 60% - Describe your personal actions to complete the task.
4. Result - 10% - Explain the positive outcomes/results of your actions or efforts.
	- Make sure to quantify your results!
#### CAR Method
- Challenge + Action + Result
	- Problem or goal to solve/accomplish
	- Steps taken to address/solve the problem
	- Outcome as a result of the actions
## Common Student Pitfalls
- Listing tools without context
	- Weak: Used Python, Git, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for course projects
- Describing tasks instead of contributions
	- Weak: Worked on a group project to build a web application for a class assignment
- The industry cares less about what you were assigned and more about what you contributed, learned, and acheived.
## Quantifying Results and Outcomes
- Numbers increase credibility and clarity
	- Performance measures
	- Scale
	- Scope
- Qualitative outcomes are okay when numbers are limited
	- Efficiency improvements
	- Reliability/maintainability gains
	- User or team impact
	- Learning outcomes achieved
## General
- Try to keep the style simple - a complicated but aesthetically pleasing resume can be difficult to scan
