## Syntax & Semantics Description
### The Issue:
- The program must be able to communicate to the compiler using rules for writing and reading program code (DWIM is never sufficient). Machine recognition is very literal.
### Vocabulary:
##### Syntax
- Refers to the form of a notation's programs, statements, and expressions. The module punctuation, spelling, and grammar - which must be exact.
- Rules for writing programs
- Form of correct statements
- Spelling, punctuation, grammar - exact
##### Semantics
- Refers to the meaning of the above - both at compile time (static) and at run time (dynamic) i.e. what is supposed to happen when syntax is used.
- Meaning of code
##### Syntax contd.
- You need an alphabet of legal symbols or characters
- Specified with lexical rules
- Valid combinations of characters are **lexenes**
- Groups of lexenes are called **tokens**
