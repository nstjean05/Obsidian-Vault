##### vonNeumann Architecture
- 4 Fundamental Principles of the architecture
	- Binary coding is fundamental to all languages, as this is how computers store information.
	- Stored programs in memory separate from the CPU
	- Instructions and data fetched from memory to CPU
	- Sequential execution
- **Not all languages are vonNeumann** (e.g. Lisp, Scheme), although they have to reside on vonNeumann architecture.
- Variables represent memory locations
- Assignment statements model moving data.
	- Called *piping*
- Efficient repetition statements are available.
- Memory stored on the CPU is processed much more rapidly that that which is not.
- The fetch-and-execute loop.
	- Loop
		- Fetch the instruction pointed to by the program counter.
		- Increment the counter to point to the next instruction.
		- Decode the instruction (into microcodes which are only used by the CPU).
		- Execute the instruction.
	- End
- Note that this loop executes indefinitely, until interrupted or specifically exited.
