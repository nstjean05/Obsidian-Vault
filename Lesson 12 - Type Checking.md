**12.**  **_Type Checking, Scope_** 

**[3]** a. Write a code snippet to illustrate that the scope of a variable may not extend to an enclosed function or procedure.
```java
main(){
	int x = 1;
	println("Hello World")
}

```

**[3]** b. Suppose you write a function or procedure with parameters and local variables in your favourite language (name it so I know what you are talking about!) What is the scope of (i) the name of the procedure (ii) the procedure parameters (iii) the procedure/function's local variables? (Languages vary in this respect.)
