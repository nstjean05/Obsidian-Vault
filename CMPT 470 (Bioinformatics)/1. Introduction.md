## General
- Bioinformatics allow biology, computer science, and information tech to merge.
	- Algorithm and stats dev
	- Data analysis and interpretation
	- Tool development
## Data Increase
- Biotech has shifted from being a primarily observational science to more of a deductive, data driven one.
- GenBank data doubles every ~14 months.
- More understanding of the relation between the sequence, structure, and function of each nucleotide.
## Dogma of Molecular Bio
- This is the flow of genetic information within a biological system, from DNA to RNA to proteins
- **Replication** is when DNA copies itself
- **Transcription** is synthesizing an RNA copy from a DNA segment
- **Translation** is when ribosomes read mRNA to assemble amino acids into chains (proteins)
