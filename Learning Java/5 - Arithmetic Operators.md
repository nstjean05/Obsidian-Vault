- There operators are used to do math in programming.
```java
int x = 10
int y = 2
int z;
```
- Addition
	- z = x + y;
	- x +=y ;
- Subtraction
	- z = z - y;
	- x -= y;
- Multiplication
	- z = z * y
	- z *= y;
 - Division
	- z = z / y;
	- z /= y;
- Modulus
	- z = z % y;
	- z %= y;
	- **Note**: Modulus display the remainder of
- Pay attention to the variable type you are using while performing operations.
	- For example, dividing integers 1 by 2 would not equal 0.5, but would round up to 1.
	- Make sure to use float or otherwise in this case.
