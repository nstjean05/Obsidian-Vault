	- It behaves as if it is the value is contains.
## Two Variable Types
- **Primitive:**
	- A value which is stored directly in memory (stack)
	- int, double, char, boolean fall under this type.
- **Reference:**
	- A memory address (stack) which points to the (heap)
	- It is a pointer to the actual value.

- Two steps:
	1. Declaration

```java
//Declaration
 int counter;
 
 System.out.println(counter);
```
