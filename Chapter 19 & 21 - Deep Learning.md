# Agents We Have Learned
### Problem Solving Agents
- Systematic search
	- Uninformed or informed
- Local Search
- Adversarial Search
### Logical Agents
- Knowledge-based agents
- Propositional Logic
- First-order logic
### Probabilistic Agents
- Quantifying Uncertainty
- Probabilistic Reasoning
# Training
- **Question: How Do We Learn?**
	- Learning problems involve classifying inputs into classifications.
	- Learning is possible only if there is a relationship between data and classifications.
	- Relationships are based on similarity.
	- **Training** --> Providing the system with manually classified data.
	- Learning systems use training data to learn to classify unseen data.
# Intelligence
- This is the capacity to learn and solve problems.
- Act rationally and reason.
# Learning Agents
- Remember the 5 aspects discussed earlier:
	1. **Learning Element**
		- Adds knowledge and make system improvements
	2. **Performance Element**
		- Perform the task and choose external actions
	3. **Critic**
		- Monitor the performance results and provide feedback
	4. **Problem Generator**
		- Actively suggest experiments and generate examples
	5. **Performance Standard**
		- Method and standard performance measures.
- An autonomous agent must learn how to use probabilities and rules on its known, and this is accomplished by machine learning.
