### Competitive Markets
- A market in which there are many buyers and sellers, so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.
- There are 3 characteristics of a competitive market:
	1. There are many buyers and sellers in the market.
	2. Goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
	3. Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
**Revenue of a competitive firm**:
- Total Revenue  = Price by Quantity
- TR = $\frac{P}{Q}$
**Average Revenue**
- $AR$ = $\frac{PQ}{Q}$ = $P$
If price is higher than average variable cost, then the firm will continue operating in the short term. If the price is below, it will shut down. If the price is below the ATC, then it will lose money but continue producing product.
