## What is AI?
- **Artificial** - Humanly contrived of a natural model.
- **Intelligence** - The ability to learn, use reason, and apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment.
- **AI** - The science and engineering of making intelligent machines.
## Acting Like Humans
- Alan Turing was the founder of computer science.
	- **Turing Test** - can you tell a human apart from an AI?
- If the human interrogator cannot determine whether the other person is human or an AI system, then the AI passes the test as behaving as intelligent.
- It must have capabilities for:
	- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	- Knowledge representation
	- Automated reasoning
	- Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics are also necessary for the "Total Turing Test".

- **Total Turing Test**
	- 1991 - Harnad dubs this as the new standard.
		- Verbal behaviours are not the sole standard for intelligence.
		- Must be able to do everything people can do.
	- Stevan Harnad is a Canadien cognitive scientist based at McGill.
		- Argued that the original test is insufficient, as it only assesses a machine's intellectual immitation.
	- TTT determines more than just whether a system is intelligent, but also if it can pass for human.
## Thinking Like Humans
- **Cognitive Modelling Approach**
	- CogSci is a branch separate from AI.
	- It's an interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.
		- Psychology
		- AI
		- Philosophy
		- Neuroscience
		- Linguistics
		- Anthropology
		- Sociology
		- Education
		- etc.
	- Includes research on intelligence, behaviour, and the representation of information.
## Thinking Rationally
- **Laws of Thought**
	- Aristotle (~450 B.C.) attempted to codify "right thinking"
	- What are correct arguments or though processes?
	- Codified the *logical syllogism*.
- There are many problems with thinking rationally.
	- Uncertainty - Not all facts are certain.
	- Resource limitations.
	- Difficult to express informal knowledge in logic.
	- Pure logic is not effective to creating AI.
	- Not all intelligent behaviour is mediated by logical deliberation.
- There is a direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI.
- By 1965, programs existed that could effectively solve any solvable problem described in LOGICIST logical notation.
## Acting Rationally
- **Rational Behaviour**: Doing the right thing.
	- The right thing is that which is expected to maximize goal achievement with the given information.
- Rational behaviour doesn't necessarily involve thinking (e.g. blinking), but should be in the service of rational action.
- Acting rationally provides the most general view of AI due to its inclusion of:
	- Correct inference (law of thought)
	- Uncertainty handling
	- Resource limitation considerations
	- Cognitive skills (NLP, Automated Reasoning (AR), knowledge representation, ML, etc.)
- **Rational Agents**
	- Agent: Something that acts
	- Rational agent is one who acts so as to achieve the best (expected) outcome.
## What is AI?
- **Strong AI**
	- A computer that can literally think and is conscious in the same way as a human.
	- View that a sufficiently complex computer could actually be intelligent and would think in the same way as a human.
	- Given lots of knowledge about the world/problems.
- **Weak AI**
	- Intelligent behaviour can be modelled, and used to solve problems.
	- Methods modelled on intelligent behaviour to make computers efficient.
	- Logic & automated reasoning.
- Term *AI* was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at a conference in Dartmouth.
## AI Research
- Two main lines of research:
	- **Biological**: Since humans are intelligent, AI should study them and imitate their psychology/physiology.
	- **Phenomenal**: Study/formalize common sense facts about the world to help acheive goals.
## History of AI
- 1943-1955
	- Initial work in AI
	- McCulloch and Pitts produce boolean model of the brain
	- Turing's *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*
- Early 1950s
	- Early AI programs
	- Minsky and Edmonds build first neural network computer
	- Newell and Simon's General Problem Solver
- 1956
	- Dartmouth workshop attended by the 'godfathers of AI'
- Late 1950s
	- Marked by enthusiasm and expectations
	- Many small successes
	- LISO, time sharing, neural networks, computer vision, etc.
- 1966-1973
	- Reality begins to hit
	- Early programs had little knowledge of their subject
	- Computational complexity
	- Negative results from perceptrons (simple neural network)
	- **Shakey**: First general-purpose robot with simple reasoning and movement.
- 1969-1986
	- Expert systems
- 1986-2000
	- The return of neural networks
- 1910s-present:
	- Big Data
	- Deep Learning, LLMs, and AI agents
