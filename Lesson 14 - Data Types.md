#### Data Type Definition
- A **Data Type** is a specification for a category of data containers that includes:
	- What values an instance of the type can take on.
	- What operations may be performed on those instances.
- Data types may be:
	1. Simple (atomic, primitive, built-in)
		- That is, not defined in terms of simple types.
		- Usually mirror logically types available in hardware.
	2. Structured (array, record, (set))
		- Has parts that are simple types
	3. Abstract (ADT)
		- Their structure, internal representation, or parts is hidden.
		- They are **transparent**.
			- The structure, parts, and possibly aspects of their representation is visible and can be manipulated by the programmer.
