### Overview
- St. Thomas lived from 1224-1274
- The "5 Ways" are 5 proofs of the existence of God, and are his magnum opus.
- Criticized for the idea that God is not omnipotent.
### The First Way: Motion
- Aquinas defines the idea of *motion*, exhibiting three methods of accidental change
	1. Change of Location
	2. Change of quality (ex. temp.)
	3. Change in quantity
- This argument claims that any of these can be changed by another, but cannot change itself. For instance, a block cannot move itself to a new location if something does not move it. In the beginning there was nothing changing, as nothing had acted. Yet something changed spontaneously, and the unchanging thing which caused this change was God.
	- Take an object with high potential energy, and one with high kinetic energy. The one with PE cannot change or move, unless it is acted upon by one with KE. A fire has high KE, and a piece of wood has high PE. The wood can only use its PE if the fire acts upon it, moving/altering the wood.
- Here it is logically:
	- If B moves A, B must have been moved by something else (C). C must have been moved by something else, D, in order to have moved B. This continues infinitely. However, if this continues infinitely, then there cannot be a *first* mover. But if there is no *first* mover, then the domino effect could not have begun. Therefore, there was a first mover (this is what some people call God).

### The Second Way: Causation
- This focuses more on *efficient causes*, a cause which is intended to create a change in something else, especially in an ordered series.
	- For example, a fire is the efficient cause of heating a kettle. This kettle may then heat water. This is an ordered series, as the water heating is dependent on there being fire.
- This analogy can also be envisioned with a series of spinning gears, which interlock one after another. Three possible scenarios arrive from this:
	1. There is an ordered series of gears (causes) which precede infinitely.
	2. The order of gears ends in a cause, which causes itself.
	3. The gears begin with an uncaused-cause.
- An ordered series of *efficient* causation will terminate in an uncaused cause, God.
### The Third Way: Possibility and Necessity
- Aquinas defines necessity as something not subject to generation or corruption. It may exist, but it can not be created by composition nor destroyed by decomposition.
