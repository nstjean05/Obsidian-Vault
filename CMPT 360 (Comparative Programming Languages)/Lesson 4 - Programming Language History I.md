### Pre-History
- Blaise Pascal
- Leibniz
- Charles Babbage 1830-1840
	- The difference engine
	- the first programmer: Ada, Countess Lovelace
- The Jacquard Loom and its punched cards
### Early Modern Era
0. Plankalkul (Zuse) 1945
	- A prototype language
1. Fortran 54-57 (Backus--IBM)
	- Later WatFIV, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90+ (ISO)
	- Scientific work
2. COBOL 59-60 (Admiral Hopper -- USN)
	- Business
3. ALGOL 58-60
	- Zurich
	- Block Structure
	- Formal Definition in BNF (a metalanguage)
	- Heavily influenced everything after
#### For Symbolic Manipulation (Functional or Applicative)
4. LISP 56-62
	- John McCarthy MIT 1958
	- non VonNeumann
	- No variables, assignments, or goto
	- now Common Lisp
	- Has some compiled versions
5. APL 56-60 (Iverson)
	- Operator rich
	- Needs a special keyboard
6. SNOBOL 60-62 (Griswald - Bell Labs)
	- StriNg Oriented symBOLic Language
	- A dynamic language-- interpreted not compiled
7. PL/1 63-74 IBM (The 'All in one language')
	- Borrowed from everything prior
	- Tried to combine COBOL, FORTRAN, LISP
	- Exception handling
	- Primitive multitasking
	- Large; many previously untried features
	- A temporary success in academia
	- Too large to learn properly
#### Late 60s ALGOL Successors
8. ALGOL-68 (Co)
