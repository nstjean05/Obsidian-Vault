### Discourses on the Method, René Descartes
##### Part 1
On page eight of Discourses on the Method, Descartes goes into great detail regarding the importance of travelling and conversing with those different from ourselves. After devoting "enough time both to the study of languages and to the reading of the books, histories, and fables of the classical world" (p. 8), he determined that it was equally important to explore the world and experience international customs. Descartes eventually lands in a position of balance, claiming that immersion in either end (academia or travel) leads to ignorance. Immersion in academia to leading to the ignorance of modern events and culture, while continual travel can make you become a stranger in your own country. I find this to be particularly important in the modern day, where for many people it is difficult to find any sort of middle ground. People argue over all manner of things because of their ignorance of history, or lack of understanding of other peoples.
Logical Reconstruction:
You cannot securely judge your own people's customs without understanding those of others.
Many people do not understand other people's customs.
Therefore many people are not secure in judging their own customs.
##### Part 2
Descartes outlines four rules, with which he claims that any and all reasoning can be made using. Firstly, to not accept anything to be true which is not incontrovertibly so. Second, divide the difficulties of examination into a multitude of parts. Following this, the third was to order thoughts use Occam's razor, building in complexity. Finally, make very general arguments so that nothing slips around the edges. I think that this is, generally, sufficient to guide reasoning. However, the first of these principles is a major leap, and I think has lead to major consequences in his writings. He has a high bar to accept what is true--which I think is a good thing. Once something makes it over this bar, though, it can wreak havoc on his arguments. For example, because of the his time, there were ideas thought to be common knowledge which we now know to be false. The way that the mind, and brain, works is much more complex than used to be thought, leading to holes in his thoughts regarding the mind-body distinction. The brain isn't simply a unified black box which takes inputs and divulges outputs, rather it is more like a complex computer with many components. I understand how Descartes utilized this rule to help make a baseline of truth for his philosophy, but it has some unfortunate side effects in the rare times it falls short.
Logical Reconstruction:
Descartes arguments are true because the fundamentals he chose were true.
Some of the fundamentals he chose are not true.
Therefore some of his arguments are not true.
##### Part 3
One of the maxims Descartes lived by was the importance of sticking to the path, once you have chosen it. This maxim is provided to help avoid "finding [yourself] lost in a forest" (p. 22), or becoming inactive due to indecisiveness. I understand his reasoning for this claim, as many people toil in one place while making no headway, simply because they cannot chose one thing to go all in on. I offer a similar critique as I did in part 2; one must not let this allow themself to become rigid due to this resolution. I know many people who fasten in their mind some fundamental belief, and charge in a futile direction based on that belief. Yes, sometimes this can lead to great success, but often it simply leads to destitution. While it is important to be resolute, work hard, and make progress, it is important to not become rigid and close your ears to others ideas and perspectives.
Logical Reconstruction:
If resolute actions were to always lead to good outcomes, then charging with fixed beliefs would never lead to bad outcomes.
Fixed beliefs can lead to bad outcomes.
Therefore resolute actions don't always have good outcomes.
##### Part 4
In part 4, Descartes makes the claim that not only is the mind separate from the body, but that it "is even easier to know than the body" (p. 20). Through this course we have discussed in depth about the potential separation between body and mind, but in this statement Descartes also proposes that the mind is even easier to know than the body. I would greatly disagree with this statement. Today, so much is known about the body, down to the smallest details. Doctors know exactly how many bones, organs, and muscles the body contains, and kinesiologists know how to push those bones and muscles to their limits. You can know, empirically, if you do something to it that something will happen. Consistently lifting weights will lead to stronger muscles, for example. The mind, however, is something else entirely. Yes, it has been explored for thousands of years, but we still do not understand how to interact with it. If you put a thousand people in an experience or life circumstance, your result will be a thousand different minds.
Logical reconstruction:
Assume all people are the same.
Then how people react to the same circumstances would be the same, but they don't.
Therefore not all people are the same.
##### Part 5
One claim that Descartes makes is that "not only that animals have less reason than man, but that they have none at all" (p. 47). I think that this is very evidently false, and so does anyone with a pet. I can very clearly watch my dog reason whether she should stay on a warm lap, or run over to the person who has just opened the fridge. This is even more emphasized in larger animals. Dolphins, for example, will bring fish up to people on docks, in the hopes that the people will interact and play with them. It may be true that most animals are not close to humans in intelligence and reasoning, but this does not mean that they have absolutely none.
Logical reconstruction.
Animals cannot reason solely because they cannot create signs to communicate with other animals.
Animals can create signs to communicate.
Therefore animals can reason.
##### Part 6
An unusual claim that Descartes makes, which may say a lot about him, is that taking on assistants/pupils to do a task will never be as useful as doing it yourself. I took problem with this, as clearly after a time, the students will catch up and the teacher would be able to multiply his efficiency many fold. In Descartes' context, of generating ideas, I can see how this may be an ineffective process. He explains how an idea is much more useful if you had to struggle to gain understanding of it (p. 58), and so giving someone the answers would be futile for their education. However, I think that it is still important and useful to teach and train other to do as you do. Even if the master dies before their student can reach their understanding, the student can have been given a launch pad from which they can reach even greater heights. This teaching may even slow down the progress of the master, but ultimately the ideas will end with the master if they are not taught to the next generation.
Logical Reconstruction:
Ideas can only be understood when all prior ones are understood by one individual, meaning there is a cap on how many ideas can understood.
New ideas are still being understood after thousands of years.
Ideas can be understood without understanding all prior ones.
### Meditations, René Descartes
##### Meditation I
One of the interesting topics frequently discussed by Descartes in his meditations is that of wakefulness and dreaming. It is so interesting to hear him discuss how all of our current reality may only be constructed in our own head. There are also medical cases of this happening, where people live whole other lives and learn languages while in a coma or similar mental state. Sometimes it is easy to detect when you are dreaming, and you can recognize that the sense of touch is not right, or that you can control your surroundings. Other times, it feels completely seamless with reality. Descartes asks us to imagine "that we are dreaming, and that these particular things (that we have our eyes open, are moving our head, stretching out our hands) are not true; and that perhaps we do not even have hands or the rest of a body like what we see" (p. 14). He explains that some truths, as ascertained by observations, may be falsified, but that other, such as mathematical truths, are constant. I agree with the observational truths being logically dubious, but I also think that math can be inconsistent. Yes we can show that two plus two equals four, but in advanced mathematics this is not necessarily always the case. Furthermore, in a dream even the most nonsensical things can seem to make perfect sense, and if we are dreaming maybe this is the case with some logic.
Logical Reconstruction:

##### Meditation II
Descartes goes into more detail about how his thinking proves his existence, claiming that thought "alone cannot be stripped from me. I am, I exist, this is certain" (p. 19). I begin to question this when viewing it from a modern lens, and the idea of simulations. Unlike dreams, simulations are not generated by the individual, and not centred on them. Characters can be given character by the simulation, but cannot tell that it is so. And yet, would this thinking character in the simulation truly exist? I think most people would say no. Similarly, generative AIs can 'think' in a sense using mathematics. Yet do they live? No, they do not. Unplugging an AI model would not count as murder.
