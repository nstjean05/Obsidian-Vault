## Virtual Reality
- Our perception of reality is filtered through our senses.
	- The mind doesn't have direct knowledge of the world.
- **Virtual reality** uses computers to create virtual environments in which one can *navigate* and *interact*.
- It is easy to trick the mind; simply alter the data from senses.
	- However, it is very difficult to trick all the senses simultaneously, even if we cannot pinpoint what is precisely wrong.
- The principal means of acquiring information is done visually, followed by sound and haptics.
	- Real-time graphics and a stereoscopic display are highly important.
- The eventual goal of VR is to create an experience that it it practically indistinguishable from reality.
## Basic Concepts
#### **Immersion**
- An objective concept
- The configuration of the UI while in a VR app
- Based on how many percepts the user has
	- Fully-immersive (Head mounted display (HMD))
	- Semi-immersive (large projection screen)
	- Non-immersive (desktop-based VR)
#### Presence
- Suspended belief
- Willingness to overlook limitations of the medium and behave as though it is a real situation
- Noted by how similarly people behave in VR to how they would in real life
	- Is the user involved and having emotional reactions?
- There is a difference between presence and involvement
	- You can watch a hockey game and be present, while not being involved in the game.
