## 1.1 - What Operating Systems Do
- A computer system can be divided into roughly 4 parts:
	- Hardware
	- OS
	- Application Programs
	- User
#### 1.1.1 User View
- The user has a number of I/O devices and applications to maximize the computer's usability.
	- Interaction goes from User --> Apps --> OS --> Hardware
- Many users now use touch screens or voice recognition as additional interaction.
#### 1.1.2 System View
- Operating systems are the computers **resource allocator**
- An OS is a **control program**
	- Manages the execution of user programs to prevent error.
#### 1.1.3 Defining OS
- An OS does not have any one definition, as there are so many applications.
- **Kernel** - The one part of an OS that is running at all times.
- **System Programs** - Associated with the OS but not part of the kernel.
- **Application Programs** - Not associated with the OS.
- **Middleware** - Set of software frameworks on mobile devices to provide services to application developers.
