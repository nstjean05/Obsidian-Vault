## 4.1 - Introduction
- Overview of four main components of a computer.
- Explains the computer processor.
- Building blocks of a CPU.
## 4.2 - The Two Basic Architectural Approaches
- Two basic approaches emerged to computing early on.
	- Harvard Architecture
	- Von Neumann Architecture
## 4.3 - The Harvard and Von Neumann Architectures
- **Harvard Architecture**: A computer organization with four components:
	- Processor
	- Instruction Memory
	- Data Memory
	- I/O Facilities

- **Von Neumann Architecture**: A computer that uses a single memory to hold both programs and data.

- The primary advantage of *Harvard architecture* is that it can have the hardware of one memory unit optimized to store programs, and another optimized for data storage.
	- It is disadvantaged by its flexibility- you cannot use any instruction memory for data memory, or vice versa.
	- Harvard architecture is now almost only used in small embedded systems or otherwise special designs.
- Von Neumann offers complete flexibility, at the cost of only marginal efficiency loss.
	- This has led it to become the default architecture in computing.
- A computer that follows V-N architecture employs a *stored program* approach, since the program is stored in memory.
- These notes will assume V-N architecture unless otherwise noted.
## 4.4 - Definition of a Processor
- *Processor* is actually not a synonym for *Central Processing Unit (CPU)*.
- A **procesor** actually has a much wider view in co
