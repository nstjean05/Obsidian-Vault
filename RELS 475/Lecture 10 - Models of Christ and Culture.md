## H. Richard Niebuhr
- Son of German immigrants
- Lived from 1894-1962
- Taught at Yale
- Key figure in developing *neo-orthodoxy*
- His brother, Reinhold Niebuhr was better known in the contemporary, at least until *Christ and Culture* released.
## Christ Versus Culture
- Culture is bad, don't touch it
- Christian's allegiance to Christ should be fundamental and ultimate
- Yet this separation is impossible - Jesus functioned within a cultural context
- At a certain point, leaning to hard on Christ against culture can lead to traps
	- Consequences:
		- Legalism - Law over grace
		- Divides reason and revelation
		- Sacred vs. secular
## Christ of Culture
- Christ represents the best of culture
- Idea that your internal negative voice that criticizes your worldliness is a bad thing - Jesus was positive!
	- Christ v. culture people embrace this as the 'voice of the spirit'
- Something not written by a Christian doesn't mean its evil
- **Conservative Christ of Culture**
	- 'Trump-vangelicals'
		- The alignment of the political with the church
		- A sense that he is a vehicle with bringing the culture back towards Christianity
	- 'Jesus was a liberal'
		- Rev. Scotty MacLennan
		- Jesus was all about lifting up the oppresed
		- Ex. Christ Church in Portland had an issue since they were so progressive
- Jesus did not reflect a concern for building cultural institutions
	- Build the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of Israel
	- His disciples were very focused on Israel
## Christ Above Culture
- Synthesis of *Against* and *Of*
	- According to Niebuhr, this is where most Christians fall
- Spectrum:
	- Of culture, Transformer, *Above Culture*, Paradox, Against
- Recognize that culture is sinful and cannot be perfected, but is not always intrinsically bad
- Jesus wasn't reduced to culture, but expressed within it
- Biblical basis
	- Incarnation and Jesus
	- Obey the government (Paul)
		- A kind of political conservatism
		- Ex. Paul doesn't outright say slavery is bad, rather he worked within the system (Philemon)
- Rick Warren - Obama visited his church (so he uses culture), but his focus is also that life really happens in heaven
- Reconcile fidelity to Christ and existence in culture
- Christ is the highest allegiance, and serving Him is transcendent
- Knowing and loving God fulfills
- Grace is required
	- There are many things that God is happy with - but know that they aren't salvation
	- Ex. Working hard in your career
- Cultural activities can be good
- **Strength**: God doesn't abandon, but is above the world
- **Weakness**: Slide into Christ of culture
