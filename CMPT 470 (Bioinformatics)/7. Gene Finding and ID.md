# How Is Genome Sequencing Actually Done?
- Genes are made of DNA, and DNA is made up of strands of 4 types (A, T, G, C)
- It took two decades to complete the first sequence of the human genome, in 2003
- DNA binds to other DNA when it is the exact opposite of it
- Each genome is replicated 1000s of times to amplify its signal
- Batches of connectors are mixed with each string, and some connect each time.
	- Depending on what connects, a different colour emerges, signalling the genome contents.
- Now we must learn how to read the signal
