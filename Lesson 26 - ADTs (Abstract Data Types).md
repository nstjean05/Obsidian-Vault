### ADTs
- **Abstraction** is a (high level) view or representation of an entity or process that obscures (deliberately hides) all but the ideas of significant interest.
	- e.g. Subprograms are process abstractions
	- e.g. Modules/Packages are encapsulation abstraction
- Different people employ different levels of abstraction.
	- e.g. An automobile looks different to...
		- Designer
		- Engineering Team
		- Assembly Line Mechanics
		- Clerks ordering parts
		- Drivers
		- Passengers
	- A computer program is likewise. The designer, programmer, and user all have different views.
	- e.g. A skill like riding a bicycle must be abstracted to the point where you do it instinctively. If you stop to think about details, you fall over.
### Built-In Data Types
- Such as float, int, CARDINAL, BOOLEAN are abstract, for they include:
	- A range of values
	- All permitted operations
	- No information on their internal structure or storage is normally available to the program unless specified
