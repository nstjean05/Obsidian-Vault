### What is a language (notation)?
- Formal notational systems for expressing problem solving abstractions in human and machine readable form.
- OR: Extended algebraic notational systems.
### Machine vs. Assembler vs. High Level Language
- Each has a different degree of legibility, and correlation with what the computer is told to do.
1. Even when writing assembler, one must know intimate details of the machine's hardware and/or firmware.
2. High level languages, especially if ISO standardized, are machine dependant.
3. Machine readability can be precisely defined, whereas human readability is an imprecise idea.
