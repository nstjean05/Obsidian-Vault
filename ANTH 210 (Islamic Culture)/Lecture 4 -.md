## The Quran
- Contains legal principles and wise statements, similar to the Hebrew scriptures
- Islam is not just religion, but also a form of government
- Islam, by Muhammad's death (632 A.D.), had spread throughout Saudi Arabia, and Northern Oman/Yemen
- Muhammad's friend and father-in-law, Abu Bakr, became his successor (caliph)
- The **caliph** governed in accordance with Muslim law as defined by the Quran
- Abu Bakr was voted in, since he was mature, rather than the 18-year-old son in law Ali
