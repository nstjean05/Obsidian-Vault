## 5.1 - Introduction
- Focus on the set of operations that a processor can perform.
- Discusses the form of operands instructions use.
## 5.2 - Mathematics, Convenience, and Cost
- Even though humans and computers can do multiplication using addition or division using subtraction, it is much more efficient to multiple or divide.
- Repeated addition/subtraction results in horrible performance.
- Computers/processors are built with additional operations to improve performance, although this takes up more space on the chip and consumes more power.
	- How many operations should we add to a chip to balance usability/efficiency?
