#### Production Possibilities
- **Production Possibilities Frontier**: Shows the various mixes of output that an economy can produce.
	- It illustrates the first principle of economics- that people face tradeoffs.
#### Advantages in Trade
- **Absolute Advantage**: The comparison among producers of a good according to their productivity.
- **Comparative Advantage**: The comparison among producers of a good according to their opportunity cost.
- The gains from specialization and trade are based not on absolute advantage, but rather on comparative advantage.
- When each person specializes in producing the good for which (s)he has a complete advantage, total production in the economy rises.
- Each benefits from trade by obtaining a good at a price that is lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good.
- This continues to show that trade can benefit everyone in society.
