- Optimizations can be achieved by:
	- Replace some software functions with hardware
	- Produce better code for special cases (compile it!)
	- **Amdahl's Law**
		- Speedup is constrained by the amount of time the machine takes to execute the program
		- Rule of thumb: Only optimize what the program spends a lot of time on
