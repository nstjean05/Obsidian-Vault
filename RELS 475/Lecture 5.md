### Recap
- Disparity between God and world
	- Ex. In a family, God first, spouse second, kids third, everyone else after.
- Disjunction of secular and transcendent
- World is secular, a place where got is 'not'
- Why is this a problem?
	- Genesis 1:31 - "God saw all that He had made, and it was very good."
### Lecture
- The earth didn't start off as a great place to be
	- Genesis 1:1-2
		- "Now the earth was formless and empty and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters."
	- Genesis 2:4-7
		- "This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being."
- The world of Genesis 1 is one in which God is transcendent, and He acts on the world
- Yet, He is also the one who is constantly sustaining us.
	- Job 34:14-15
		- If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath, all humanity would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
	- Augustine - Why are we restless? Because this breath is irritating us to become so.
