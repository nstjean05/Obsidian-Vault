# Early Christianity
1. Second Century
	- Christianity was urban, somewhat unlike today
	- Rome's roads and empire helped facilitate the early spread of Christianity
2. Four important urban centres
	- Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria
	- Paul made four early missionary journeys
		- He often visited the synagogues upon entering a new city
	- The early church was highly multicultural and had a diverse composition of thought
## Christianity in a Hellenistic Context
1. It becomes illegal
	- Romans saw Christians as weird Jews
	- Once they became distinct from Judaism, issues arose
2. As Christianity expands, it needed to better articulate its methods
	- Leads to development in theology
3. The gospel
## Hellenistic Contexts
- Religious
	- Polytheism/Pluralism
- Theological & Philosophical
	- Platonists
		- The divine/God was essentially a super-mind
		- An absolute, unchanging, spiritual being
		- Static perfection
	- Aristotelians
	- Stoics
## Two Scandals of Christ
### Christ is Lord
- There is only one God, and only that God should be worshipped
- Mutually exclusive with the worship of other gods
- This conflicts with their pantheon and ideas of polytheism
### God Incarnate
- Incarnate = In the flesh
- This clashes with Platonism, as God was seen as the opposite of a human being - eternal, metaphysical, ineffable
# Christianity and Rome
## Christianity in the Shadows
- It begins on the edge of Rome's empire in small Jewish groups
