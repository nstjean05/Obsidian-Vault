## 3.1 - Introduction
- Examination of binary representations used by computers for data.
	- Integer
	- Characters
	- Floating Point
- Show the consequences of representing data in binary.
## 3.2 - Definitions Of Bit And Byte
- **Bit** - Short for *Binary Digit*
	- Can Have two possible values.
	- Often represented in hardware as two voltage levels.
		- High/low or true/false
	- Software engineers generally use 0/1
- **Byte** - String of eight bits
	- This is needed as bits are too small in most applications
	- A byte contains eight hardware units, each holding a bit
	- These units work in parallel, delivering all eight bytes at the same time, giving the appearance of a single piece of hardware.
## 3.3 - Possible Values In A Byte
- A decimal number with *k* digits can represent a range of 10$^k$ digits.
	- Each bit can represent 2 possible values.
	- A byte generally has 8 bits.
	- A byte can represent 2$^8$ = 256 values.
		- Range 0 to 2
