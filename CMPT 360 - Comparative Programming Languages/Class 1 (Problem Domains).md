### What is a language (notation)?
- Formal notational systems for expressing problem solving abstractions in human and machine readable form.
- OR: Extended algebraic notational systems.
### Machine vs. Assembler vs. High Level Language
- Each has a different degree of legibility, and correlation with what the computer is told to do.
1. Even when writing assembler, one must know intimate details of the machine's hardware and/or firmware.
2. High level languages, especially if ISO standardized, are machine dependant.
3. Machine readability can be precisely defined, whereas human readability is an imprecise idea.
### Why Study Programming Notations?
- Increased ability to express abstractions of problems and their solutions.
- To best choose appropriate programming tools.
- Increased ability to learn new notations.
- To better understand implementation issues.
- To more efficiently use the tools you know.
- To know how and why notations are designed.
- To know when and why to accept a design.
- To create a language design.
### What are the problem solving domains?
##### Scientific
- Many computations, much use of arrays.
	- Fortran, APL, C++, Julia, Algol
##### Business
- Reports, computations in fixed-point numerals.
	- COBOL, RPG, C++, Delphi, Database proprietary languages, Application specific languages.
##### AI/Machine Learning
- Symbols other than numerals are manipulated, much use of lists.
	- Prolog, LISP, Scheme.
##### Systems Programming
- Continuous use, must access hardware, OS.
	- C, Modula-2, and their many derivatives.
##### Scripting
- Automating applications and workflows.
	- OS Shells, awk, tcl/tk, AppleScript, ECMAScrip (ISO std name for JavaScript), Perl, PHP & MySQL, Ruby.
##### Commercial Applications
- General Purposes.
	- C, C++, C#, Objective C, Swift, Java, Modula-2, Python.
##### Internet
- Web Programming.
	- Markup - HTML
	- Scripting/Database - PHP & MySQL
	- General Purpose - Java, C#
	- Scripting Languages
##### Embedded Systems
- Real time applications, such as robotics.
	- Modula-2, Ada, C++, R, Specialty Languages.
##### Application Specific Languages
- Scripting applications: spreadsheets, database managers.
	- VBA, DataBase Languages (Pascal, Modula-2, C), Specialty Languages.
##### Other
- There are many, many other:
	- Languages
	- Programming Environments
	- Libraries of pre-written code that can be called
	- Applications or OS specific APIs, etc.
