2. **FÂ  22.3-22.4 Basic circuits and transistors**

a. What is the difference between a pnp and an npn transistor?
- An NPN transistor effectively amplifies a positive signal applied to its base, whereas a PNP transistor allows current to flow if a negative voltage is applied to it. Often NPN transistors are used in electronics as they transfer energy very quickly, and are slightly cheaper to manufacture. PNP transistors can be useful in many scenarios as well. One such case is when working with oscillating signals, it can be beneficial to use a PNP and an NPN transistor in tandem to more efficiently amplify the signals.

b. What are the input and output value ranges for (i) 3V logic (ii) 5V logic?
	i) In 3V logic, the input is 0.8-2.0 volts, and the output is 2.7-3.6 volts.
	ii) Using 5V logic,
