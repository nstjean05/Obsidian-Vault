## Epistemology
- A major branch of philosophy, this studies the theory of knowledge.
- How do we relate the mind to objective reality?
- What is meant by knowing something?
- How can something actually become knowledge?
- What is the scope of knowledge?
## Basis of Knowledge Claims
1. Truth
	- The claim that can be proven true (or at least there is strong evidence for it)
2. Belief
	- The knower ascents to that truth
3. Justification
	- The knower can defend that truth
	- This requires understanding
## How is Knowledge Acquired?
1. Authority Source
2. Intuition
3. Rational Deduction
	1. Proposition: All bears have fur
	2. Instance: A bear lives in Langley
	3. Deduction: That Langley bear has fur
4. Rational Induction
5. Empiricism/Scientific Method
6. Transmission of collective memory
## Consilience vs Concinnity
- Many problems are too big to solve within one discipline and require integrating knowledge and experience from many areas
- Consilience (Empirical Solutions)
	- Humans created knowledge, so we can create patterns of connection to unit disciplines.
- Concinnity (Holistic Solutions)
	- All truth is God's created truth, and His universe is unity.
	- Knowledge of it and its connectedness
