## Graph Nomenclature
- Similarly to trees, *graphs* are made up of nodes, and the connection between those nodes.
- On graphs, we refer to nodes as *vertices* and refer to connections as *edges*.
- Vertices are typically referred to with a name.
- An *undirected graph* is a graph where the pairings representing the edges are unodered.
- A graph G = (V,E) is composed of:
	- V: set of *vertices*
	- E: set of *edges* connecting the *vertices* in V.

- A graph G is an ordered pair (V,E) consisting of the vertex set (V) and edge set (E)
