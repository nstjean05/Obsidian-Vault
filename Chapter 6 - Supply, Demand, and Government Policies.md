#### Price Controls
- **Price Ceiling**: The legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold.
- **Price Floor**: Legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold.
- If the government puts a ceiling or floor on a good, two outcomes are possible:
	- The control is not binding, and the price remains at some equilibrium point.
	- Control is binding, and the price is forced higher or lower than the good's value.
