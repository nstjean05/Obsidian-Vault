### Discourses on the Method, René Descartes
##### Part 1
On page eight of Discourses on the Method, Descartes goes into great detail regarding the importance of travelling and conversing with those different from ourselves. After devoting "enough time both to the study of languages and to the reading of the books, histories, and fables of the classical world" (p. 8), he determined that it was equally important to explore the world and experience international customs. Descartes eventually lands in a position of balance, claiming that immersion in either end (academia or travel) leads to ignorance. Immersion in academia to leading to the ignorance of modern events and culture, while continual travel can make you become a stranger in your own country. I find this to be particularly important in the modern day, where for many people it is difficult to find any sort of middle ground. People argue over all manner of things because of their ignorance of history, or lack of understanding of other peoples.
Logical Reconstruction:
You cannot securely judge your own people's customs without understanding those of others.
Many people do not understand other people's customs.
Therefore many people are not secure in judging their own customs.
##### Part 2
Descartes outlines four rules, with which he claims that any and all reasoning can be made using. Firstly, to not accept anything to be true which is not incontrovertibly so. Second, divide the difficulties of examination into a multitude of parts. Following this, the third was to order thoughts use Occam's razor, building in complexity. Finally, make very general arguments so that nothing slips around the edges. I think that this is, generally, sufficient to guide reasoning. However, the first of these principles is a major leap, and I think has lead to major consequences in his writings. He has a high bar to accept what is true--which I think is a good thing. Once something makes it over this bar, though, it can wreak havoc on his arguments. For example, because of the his time, there were ideas thought to be common knowledge which we now know to be false. The way that the mind, and brain, works is much more complex than used to be thought, leading to holes in his thoughts regarding the mind-body distinction. The brain isn't simply a unified black box which takes inputs and divulges outputs, rather it is more like a complex computer with many components. I understand how Descartes utilized this rule to help make a baseline of truth for his philosophy, but it has some unfortunate side effects in the rare times it falls short.
Logical Reconstruction:
Descartes arguments are true because the fundamentals he chose were true.
Some of the fundamentals he chose are not true.
Therefore some of his arguments are not true.
##### Part 3
One of the maxims Descartes lived by was the importance of sticking to the path, once you have chosen it. This maxim is provided to help avoid "finding [yourself] lost in a forest" (p. 22), or becoming inactive due to indecisiveness. I understand his reasoning for this claim, as many people toil in one place while making no headway, simply because they cannot chose one thing to go all in on. I offer a similar critique as I did in part 2; one must not let this allow themself to become rigid due to this resolution. I know many people who fasten in their mind some fundamental belief, and charge in a futile direction based on that belief. Yes, sometimes this can lead to great success, but often it simply leads to destitution. While it is important to be resolute, work hard, and make progress, it is important to not become rigid and close your ears to others ideas and perspectives.
Logical Reconstruction:
Moving in a straight line will lead you somewhere else.
It is better to be somewhere else than where you are now.
