### Aquinas' 5th Way
- Aquinas claims that everything acts towards an end. Even an electron attracts positively charged particles. Natural beings act in similar ways towards an end, and if this is true then they must be directed by something with cognition and intelligence. That director of unthinking things is claimed to be God.
### The Problem of Evil
- Epicurus (341-270 B.C.) was a Greek philosopher who we have the first account of having grappled with the idea of evil, questioning a morally perfect God.
- He proves that God does not exist by this:
	- God is aware of evil, capable of getting rid of it, and wanting to get rid of this.
	- Evil exists, so God hasn't gotten rid of this even though he is capable and wanting.
	- God cannot exist.
### The Euthyphro Dilemma
- Option A: Something is good, because God deems it so.
	- Problem: Morality is relative/arbitrary.
		- If God claimed hurting someone is good, then it would be so.
	- Does this mean that morality is ungrounded?
- Option B: God commands something, because it is good.
	- Problem: Morality is independent/greater than God.
	- God simply recognizes the truth, rather than being the source of it.
- The philosopher Euthyphro claimed that something was good because the Greek gods loved it.
