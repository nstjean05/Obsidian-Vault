#### Pointer Types
- Also known as *access types* (Ada) or *reference types*
- These types are pointers to or logical addresses of an entity residing at that location. 
- They may be themselves types so that
	- `POINTER TO REAL` has its own type distinct from `POINTER TO CARDINAL`
	- Or all just of types `ADDRESS` (or compatible with it)
- They have values in an abstract range of memory location
	- These are only connected to and not identical with machine addresses.
- They have a specific value, `NIL`, `nul`, or some similar name that points nowhere.
- They reference a particular type of data at that address
	- Where an appropriate amount of memory for the data is reserved heap-dynamically.
- They are not themselves structured types because they only have one component themselves - a virtual address.
	- What they point to is not a component of themselves.
	- So if `myPoint` is a pointer or reference to memory `myPoint` is an address of a location, a reference `myPointA` or `*myPoint` or `myPoint.` is the actual data.
