3. _Circuit Building blocks and Gates_ **_22.5-22.7_**

a. Make a truth table for (a + b) * c and design a circuit from transistors to implement this

b. Design a circuit using 2-input gates, to express [(a * b) + (c * d)] * e

c.Â  **22.3, 22.7**

d. design from 2-input gates, a circuit to express [(a OR b OR c) AND ( NOT (c AND d AND e) )]

e. Produce a truth table for a three-input EOR gate (any one or two, but not all three)
