## Buses
- Are a mechanism that allows 2 or more units to transfer simultaneously
	- Control lines
	- Data lines
	- 32 or 64 bits
	- These are almost always parallel
- Can be for:
	- Memory - Need address lines as well
	- I/O
- May be:
	- Proprietary / Internal
	- Standard / External / both
- Most buses are shared (Multi-purpose, select with control line)
- Memory devices are usually plugged directly into a bus
## Required
- Access protocol interface (available to CPU & devices & memory)
- Control circuitry to select read/write, device/memory, etc.
- Selection circuitry to select memory location/specific device.
- (may be) slots for plugging in interface cards.
	- These have assigned addresses, may have on board buffer memory, CPU, and control lines at fixed addresses
- Modifying the fetch store cycles
	- Select bus
	- Select device
	- Use control line to select a bus.
	- Use control line to select a device
	- Place address on address lines
	- If storing place data on data lines
	- Specify store or fetch
	- Wait on control lines for operation to complete
	- If fetching, latch data from data lines
	- If fetching, move data from data lines
	- Use control lines to free device
	- Use control lines to free bus
