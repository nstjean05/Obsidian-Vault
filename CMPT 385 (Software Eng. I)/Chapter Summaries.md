# Ch. 2 – Process Models
- Process Models --> Framework of activities actions, and work tasks.
	- Various models have different flows, organized sequentially or chronologically.
	- These patterns are useful for solving common software process challenges.
### Prescriptive Models
- Bring order and structure to software development.
- Vary, but have the same framework of generic activities.
	- Communication
	- Planning
	- Modelling
	- Construction
#### Sequential
- Older paradigms such as the waterfall model.
	- Communication > Planning > Modelling > Construction > Deployment
	- Each can only begin when the prior is complete.
- Linear process flow
	- Often inconsistent with reality.
#### Incremental
- Iterative in nature, and quickly produce a working version of software
- Includes the prototyping and spiral model.
- **Prototyping Model**
	- Good when the customer has a lot of unknown variables.
	- Communication > Quick Plan > Modelling and Quick Design > Prototype > Deployment/Feedback > More Communication
- **Spiral Model**
	- Start in the middle, and spiral out.
	- Begin with communication > planning > modelling > construction > deployment/feedback > communication
	- Useful for designing large-scale systems
#### Unified Process Model
- Similar to the spiral model, but conducted in increments after each deployment.
# Ch. 3 – Agility and Process
- Agile is optimized for modern, rapidly changing market conditions
- There are four key issues:
	1. Self-organizing teams with control over their work.
	2. Communication and collaboration between team members, practitioners, and customers.
	3. Recognition that change represents an opportunity.
	4. Rapid delivery of software the satisfies the customer.
- Agile can greatly lower the cost of change as the project progresses.
- Criticized for not holding up at organizational-scale development.
#### Scrum
- 15-min meeting each 24 hours, over a period of 4 weeks (a sprint).
- 3 Questions at each meeting:
	1. What did you do since last meeting?
	2. What obstacles do you have?
	3. What do you plan to do by next meeting?
