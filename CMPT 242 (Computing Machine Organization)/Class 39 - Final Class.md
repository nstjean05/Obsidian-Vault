## The Course From a Textbook POV
- Format is Number. Chapter, Section
1. Overview, All
2. Programs, See 360
3. Representation, 3.1 --> 3.17
4. Processors, All (from a high level)
	- Use Sutcliffe's definition of Von Neumann for software, textbook def for hardware.
	- For software, the Von Neumann architecture is
		- binary storage, sequential operation
	- For hardware, a computer that uses a single memory to hold both programs and data.
5. Instruction Sets, All except 5.17, 23 --> 25
6. Operands, All but 6.11
7. Assembler, All but 7.10 --> 7.12
8. Memory and Addressing, 8.1 --> 8.6, 8.9, 8.16, 8.17
9. Virtual Memory, 9.1 --> 9.6, 9.11, 9.16
10. Cache, 10.1 --> 10.5, 10.10, 10.13, 10.16 --> 10.18
11. Storage & File Systems, 11.1 --> 11.5, 11.13
12. Devices, I/O, & Buffering, 12.1 --> 12.6
13. Busses & their Architecture, 13.1 --> 13.9, 13.14, 13.21, 13.22, 13.4
14. Programming Devices, 14.1 --> 14.7, 14.10 --> 14.12
