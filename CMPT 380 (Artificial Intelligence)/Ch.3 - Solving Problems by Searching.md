## Reflex Agent
- Actions are a direct mapping from their state.
- Can't work well in environments
	- Mapping takes up too much storage.
	- Takes a long time to learn.
- A goal-based agent works better here.
## Problem-Solving Agent
- A variant of goal-based agent.
- Solves problems by finding sequences of actions leading to desirable goals.
- First step of problem solving is making a goal.
## Goal Formulation
- Goal is formulated as a set of world states wherein the goal is satisfied.
- Actions are the operators which take the agents from its initial state to its goal state.
## Problem Formulation
- This is the process of deciding which actions and states to consider.
