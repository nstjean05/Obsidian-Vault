- **Stereo Vision** is the main source of depth perception
	- Slight difference in the angle of the two eyes in what they see
- **Monocular Cues** allow one eye to see some depth
	- Light/shade
	- Relative Size
	- Overlap
	- etc.
## Virtual Visual System
- There are several factors for a sense of visual immersion
	- FOV
	- Refresh rate
	- Stereopsis: ability to perceive the world in 3D
	- Resolution
## Graphical Display Technologies
- **Cathode-Ray Tubes** (CRTs):
	- Invented by Karl Ferdinand in 1879
	- Coils use magnetism to deflect the ray of electrons to a point of phosphor, which displays on the screen
- **Liquid Crystal Displays** (LCDs):
	- Discovered by Friedrich Reinitzer in 1888
