## Human Vision
- Primary source of information about the outside world
- Not always the most relevant, but often used to double check other senses accuracy
- **Stereo Vision** is the main source of depth perception
	- Slight difference in the angle of the two eyes in what they see
- **Monocular Cues** allow one eye to see some depth
	- Light/shade
	- Relative Size
	- Overlap
	- etc.
## Virtual Visual System
- There are several factors for a sense of visual immersion
	- FOV
	- Refresh rate
	- Stereopsis: ability to perceive the world in 3D
	- Resolution
## Graphical Display Technologies
#### Cathode-Ray Tubes (CRTs):
- Invented by Karl Ferdinand in 1879
- Coils use magnetism to deflect the ray of electrons to a point of phosphor, which displays on the screen
#### Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs):
- Discovered by Friedrich Reinitzer in 1888
- Uses liquid crystal, which twists to let pass through, or untwists to block it.
- Six layers:
	1. Vertical polarizing film
	2. Glass substrate with ITO electrodes (determines shape when LCD is on)
	3. Twisted nematic liquid crystal
	4. Glass substrate with common electrode film (horizontal ridges to align with horizontal filter)
	5. Horizontal polarizing film
	6. Reflective surface to send light to viewer
		- Backlit lCDs replace this with a light source
- Two types of LCDS:
	- Passive-Matrix
		- Simple grid of two glass layers (row/col), with liquid crystal between them
		- Charge sent to a particular col/row to turn on a pixel
		- Slow and imprecise voltage control
	- Active-Matrix
		- Thin film transistors (TFTs) are arranged in a matrix on the glass
		- Only the proper row and column are switched on
		- Amount of voltage is proportional to light passing through
		- Colour LCDs have 3 sub-pixels (RGB)
#### Plasma Displays
- Invented in 1964 at University of Illinois
- Flat display with many cells between two glass panels, containing inert gases
	- Electrically turned in a plasma (UV) to emit light
- Wide screen, high brightness, fast response, wide view
- Screen burn-in, more power
#### Digital Light Processing
- Uses light
