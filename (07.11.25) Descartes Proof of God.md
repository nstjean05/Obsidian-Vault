# Descartes: Meditation 2
- I think, therefore I am
1. Perhaps I am deceived
	1. If I am deceived, I still know that I exist.
- The very nature of being is thinking.
# The Cogito Arguments of Descartes and Augustine
- *Meditations* is written in a stream-of-thought style.
- In his first argument, Descartes discards God as the cause of his thoughts.
	- This causes issue later on, as he believes in an 'evil deceiver'. If you can create your own thoughts, surely you can also create your own deceptions?
	- We also have no evidence for the evil deceiver.
- I think therefore I am has two flaws:
	- Do you not exist if you are not thinking?
	- The *I am* part of the quote suggests separation between being and thought. However, the argument does not prove the *I*, rather it proves thought.
		- Therefore at most, it proves that *thought exists*.
#### Augustine's "Si fallor, sum" Argument
- "If I Am Mistaken, I Exist"
1. If I can consider whether I might be mistaken about my own existence, then I know that I exist because the ability to consider something is a sufficient condition for existence.
2. I can consider whether I might by mistaken about my own existence.
	1. I know that I exist.
- The reciprocal is also true.
