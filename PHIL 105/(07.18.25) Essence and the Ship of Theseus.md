# Kant's Refutation of Idealism
- Descartes had concern of whether we may be trapped inside some kind of simulation.
	- Your sequence of experiences have no basis in the real world.
- Kant claims that the ability to experience things in time needs to be more than simply a sequence of mental states.
	1. Experiences aren't inherently ordered when looked at from within.
	2. Humans need a way to order them, and we do so using time passing.
- Therefore, it is Kant's view is that we can only order them definitively in relation to an objective standard, which must exist outside the mind.
	- Since humans experience things in a definitively time-ordered way and we need an external sequence to make that possible, then our experience is shaped by an outside world.
	- This means that Cartesian Skepticism is invalid, since humans would not be able to be aware of time, unless we were interacting with it.
- All in: our awareness of time proves that we are connected to reality.
- Lots of modern commentators disagree with the premise of transcendental arguments, including this one.
	- They, by nature, have an unlikely jump from how people have constructed the world in order to make sense of it versus how the world actually is.
		- For instance, for most of history people separated matter into the elements as the base division. Then eventually into matter, physical atoms and particles. Now we understand some of string theory, that nothing is 'physical', rather being an interaction of waves. Although we at first constructed the world as being made of earth and fire, that is not the base reality, and was used to make sense of our surroundings.
- Kant's logical steps:
	1. I am self aware as having experiences ordered in time, which contain objects and events distinct from my mental state.
	2. If (P1), then I make judgements about the temporal order of my mental states.
	3. There are no grounds for ordering my mental states found within the form/content of those states.
	4. If (P3), then if I am self conscious, then there is something separate from my mental which their changes can be ordered by.
	5. If (P4), then objects of experience exist outside my mind.
	6. If these objects exist outside my mind, then they must exist in space.
