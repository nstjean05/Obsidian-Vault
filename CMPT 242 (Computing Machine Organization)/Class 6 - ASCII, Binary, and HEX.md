6.Â  _ASCII, Binary, Hexadecimal representation, widening the representation, IEEE floating point 3.8, 3.9, 3.17-3.20_

a. Look up EBCDIC character coding and give an explanation of how it worked and compared to ASCII.

b. Design and hand in a circuit that would divide a clock signal by 10. You have only 8-bit counters.

c. (lookup) Is an Intel chip big or little endian? (Later I may ask you to write a program demonstrating this, so be sure you understand the concept. Give me your reference too. )

d. (bonus) Besides using multiple F.A. circuits (one per bit) find a way to build a multiple bit adder, design the circuit and print it out, then show by the truth table it is correct. You need only extend it to two bits. If that much works, you can obviously extend it further.
