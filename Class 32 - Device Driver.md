- The DD interaction is modulated by:
	- A request queue (in the CSR space) where the API deposits requests and the back end fetches them.
		- Control Status Register
		- Application Programming Interface
	- One or more data buffers for temporary storage
		- Waiting on the appropriate commands.
- **Note**: Because the back end generates interrupts on task completion, it enables itself to be re-invoked to service the next request
	- The instruction flow could be modified
	- If request queue empty, clean interrupt status return
- **Note:** A device driver CSR has an interrupt bit that can be set by calling the API to force an interrupt.
	- If it is idle, if already working nothing happens.
	- Effect of doing this: The APU need not ask if the device is busy - just set the bit and drop in a request.
- Queued Input
	- Can be handled simply with input events and dot buffered by the backend - waiting for the application to pull data via requests.
