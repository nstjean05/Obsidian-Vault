## Agents
- An *agent* is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors, and acting upon that information.
- There are both human and robotic agents, both with their own kinds of sensors.
- **Percept:** Agent's perceptual inputs at any one time.
- **Percept Sequence**: The complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
- Environment -->Perceive --> Sensors --> Agent Processes --> Actuators --> Act on the environment
- **Agent Program**
