# The Craft
- **Anima**: Soul, in Latin
	- **Animate**: Give life to an inanimate object, image, or drawing
	- **Animation**: Display of movement by rapidly displaying many still images
### Cel Animation
- Hand-drawn, and most common traditional method
- Pencil test --> Cleanup --> Ink and Paint
- Foreground contains characters/letters
- Background contains painted or photographic images
### Stop-Motion Animation
- Animate a jointed model and record the different positions on a single frame each
- Used in visual effects in live action films from the 1930s-50s
	- King Kong, etc.
- Miniature models with clay, rubber skin, and a wire skeleton
### Animatronics
- Computer-controlled models which can be animated in real-time
- Eliminate the need for composing later in production
- Programmed with forward and inverse kinematics software
### Performance Animation
- Live character controls the performance of an animated character
- Puppets/actor in a suit
### Character Animation
- Bring life to imagined or virtual characters
- The highest form of animation
- Created using a combination of inverse and forward kinematic techniques, and motion capture
### Effects Animation
- Animation which isn't character oriented
- Natural phenomena (rain, snow, smoke, rivers, etc.)
- Special lighting effects
- Techniques like particle systems, procedural techniques, and dynamic simulations
### Visual Effects for Live Action
- Main goal is to complement the live action
- Animated elements must visually match the live sequence
	- Motion, lighting, perspective, etc.
# Introduction to Computer Animation
- **Computer Animation**: The illusion of movement is created by displaying on a screen a series of individual states of a dynamic scene
- **Computer Animation Sequence**: A set of objects characterized by state variables evolving over time
- **Animators**: Those who design the objects dynamic behaviour
- **Animation Systems**: Provide users with motion control tools
- **Scientific Visualization**: Computer animation helps to understand physical laws when new models are created and simulated
### Animation Types
- **Real Time Animation**: Computer calculates the movement fast enough to see them in real time.
- **Image by Image**: Traditional animation
	- Calculate the image --> Record them digitally --> Visualize/project them
### Articulated Bodies/Virtual Characters
- **Virtual characters**: Articulated figures with multiple layers
- **Skeleton**: Hierarchically organized set of joints
- **Humanoid Animation Specification** (H-Anim)
	- Standard for common representation for virtual humans
	- Defined by Web3D for VRML and MPEG4
	- Fixed topology and naming convention for the structure
	- Specify tools for adding an outer mesh, the skin or cloth
# Motion Control Methods
- According to the nature of privileged information at the level of animation control:
	- **Geometric**
		- Heavily relied on by the animator who provides lots of geometric data
	- **Physical**
		- Use physical laws to animate a simulation
	- **Behavioural**
		- Drives the behaviour of objects by providing high-level directives for a specific behaviour
		- Ex. Autonomous creatures
# Motion Capture and Performance Animation
- Measuring and recording direct actions of a real person or animal
- Used for 3D character animation
- Mapping measurements onto the motion of a digital character
	- Direct = Human arm motion controls characters arm
	- Indirect = Mouse movement controls a characters head direction
	- Real-time = Important in VR, allows position and orientation of a user's limbs etc.
### Optical Motion Capture Systems
- **Passive Optical Systems**
