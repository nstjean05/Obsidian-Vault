## Islam's Family Tree
- Isaac is important to Christianity, since he is the son of Sarah, Abraham's 'true' wife
- Ishmael is important to Islam, since his lineage leads to Muhammad
	- Furthermore, Islamic thinking tracks by the father, not the wife(s)
	- Additionally, Ishmael is Abraham's firstborn
- The second book in Islam is called the *Hadith*, which is a history
	- Similar to the Bible's gospels
## Early Life
- Muhammad was born during 'the year of the elephant'
	- A war between Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, wherein a failed assault occurred on Mecca using elephants
- His mother died when he was 6 years old, and his father just before his birth
- Born to a respectable but not wealthy family
	- Sent to live with his grandfather, who died two years later
	- Went to live with his uncle, who had a son called Ali. They became like brothers
- Often in paintings, if two eyes are shown then they are 'good guys', but only one eye indicates 'bad' people
- Faces of holy people are covered in Islam, and this is seen by Muslims as a shortcoming of Christianity
	- If you put your own 'spin' on an image, this allows people to have an imagination, and inaccuracies
## Miracles
- Every year there was an argument at Meccah about who would carry out the black stone (meteorite)
	- Muhammad proposed that it was put on a carpet and someone from each of the tribes would carry it together, so that no one was greater than another
- Muhammad didn't do any miracles in the same way as Jesus
	- Muslims respect Jesus for doing so many of these
- Muhammad got married to Kadija at 25, which gave him financial stability since his wife had business in trading
## Revelations
- In 610 AD, Muhammad received the first of many revelations while meditating and praying in the desert.
- He was commanded by Gabriel to teach all people two things;
	1. An unquestioned belief in God (Allah)
	2. A deep commitment to social justice
- This was miraculous, as he was unable to read nor write, but in this instance did both
- Qadr 97:1-5
	- He begins to doubt himself, but Kadija reaffirmed him
- He is taken up to heaven on a horse, where he meets the prior prophets, who tell him that he is the final prophet
- Muslims argue that in the time of Moses, Judaism was correct. In the time of Jesus, Christianity was correct. Since the time of Muhammad, Islam is correct.
	- We must use the most updated version
	- The issue with Christians are that they're stuck in the second message.
## Teaching In Mecca and Medina
- Muhammad began teaching in Mecca, but he converted few people outside of this own circle
- Meccans feared that his new faith might be a detriment.
	- Question the legitimacy of the shrines in Mecca
	- Jeopardize the traditional pilgrimages to the Kaaba
	- Reduce incoming trade
- When Muhammad and his followers were forced out, they fled to Medina (Yathrib)
	- He was asked to be the leader in Medina, as they were troubled by dissent
	- Medina is a term for *city*, but Yathrib became colloquially known as such
- The journey from Mecca to Medina is called the Hijra
	- This event is of such significance that 622 is the year in which the Islamic calendar begins.
- The first mosque was in Medina
- A large community of believers began to gather here
	- Faith replaced blood ties, leading to greater unity
- In the 620 there were a number of attacks by Muhammad's followers on Meccan caravans
	- Culminated in 630 when Muhammad returned to Mecca in triumph
	- Created confidence
- When you die, especially as a martyr, your book of life is closed
	- Shortcut to heaven
## The Return to Mecca
- He returns to Mecca as a prophet
- Muhammad makes it very clear that Ali is to be in charge after him
	- All 3 of Muhammad's sons died, and Ali married his daughter
- This is a major debate, as another group says that Muhammad never says Ali is to be his successor
- Kadija died after they returned
	- Once this happens, Muhammad took one wife from each of the tribes
	- There are few sources about it, and little detail, so it is hard to absolutely know the cause of this
- Muhammad asks people to surrender themselves under God
- Initiates the five pillars
	1. Faith - One God
	2. Prayer - 5 Times/Day Towards Mecca
	3. Alms - Give to the Poor (2.5% of net worth, once per year)
	4. Fasting - Ramadan
	5. Pilgrimage - Go to Mecca
## Early Islam
- The pillars affirmed Islam and built a sense of community
- Leader of the church (like a pastor) is called:
	- Shia - Imam
	- Sunni - Mullah
	- These leaders led Friday prayers and usually offered sermons
- However, there is no official appointments
- There are further religious appointments of judges who answer questions of the law
	- Shia - Mufti
	- Sunni - Ayatollah
- In order to become an Ayatollah, you have to be a *Sayed*
	- Sayeds come from the family of the prophet Muhammad
	- Therefore, they are enlightened, having greater authority
	- Can't argue with them in the same way as a Mufti
- **The Sunna** were compiled after Muhammad by his followers
	- Some additional teachings, sayings, and prayers
