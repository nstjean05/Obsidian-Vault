- Your strategies for parameters if using Assembler
	- Push/pull with stack as above.
	- Reserve some scratch memory for these
- Sometimes the OS may reserve page 0 addresses 0 --> n(256)
	- You might  be able to use some of these
	- You might use some of the registers to store parameters.
- You may have a block of registers with an index to the first computer register number and references relative to that.
- Put 6 arguments in R$_n$ ... R$_n$$_+$$_6$  
	- Set window index to n
	- jsr
	- The subroutine accesses these as 0 --> 5
1. There is a sample of a minimal set of instructions (MIPS) in 5.23
	- In some instruction sets R$_0$ gives you fast access to the value 0.
