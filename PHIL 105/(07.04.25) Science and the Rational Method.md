# The Hume Induction
- Scepticism - We know a lot less than we think we do.
- We assume that we know a lot of things, which we have not observed.
	- Ex. Most people believe that the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, although not many have seen them.
- How do we determine that something unobserved is true?
- We can prove that any triangle will have angles adding to 180*.
	- This is a **necessary truth**.
		- These are claims that must be true.
		- Gathering evidence is not necessary.
		- Known as a *relation of ideas* or the *operation of thought*
- **Matters of Fact** are truths which are true, but disagreeing with it is not inconceivable.
	- For example I have a small dog, but it is not impossible to think that I might be lying about that.
- **Kant**
	- A Posteriori - Matters of Fact
	- A Priori - Relations of Ideas.
# Hume's Skepticism
- How can we know about matters of fact which are neither determined by observation, nor operation of thought.
	- **Observed Regularities**: Because all of something has x quality, then we assume that the next of something will also have that quality.
		- All fires I've touched have been hot, so that fire over there is also hot.
		- This argument uses induction.
		- However, sometimes this is not a good argument, as things can change their qualities.
			- Each of the hairs on my head are orange, so when the next hair grows it will also be orange. Yet when I get old, this may not be so.
		- We may rely on induction when making general inferences about our environment.
- Science can tell us about the laws of nature.
	- Hume argues that this is simply relying on inductive reasoning.
	- For example, gravity will continue to work. Is it possible that it may not one day?
		- You can coherently make a story about a day in which gravity ceases to hold the Earth in rotation around the sun.
- Maybe we can use induction to prove the uniformity of nature.
	- In the past, the future has resembled the past, so in the future the future will resemble the past.
	- This uses circular reasoning, and is therefore an invalid argument.
- Relying on induction can be a good way to form beliefs.
- But what makes induction a better way to determine the future, rather then our own wants?
	- Generally, circular arguments are produced.
- **Hume's argument:** There's no rationally compelling reason to use induction.
	- However, we can't avoid using induction because it is so instinctual.
	- We do not use induction for its rationality, and are unable to force ourselves to behave totally rationally.
# The Cartesian Dreaming Argument for External-World Skepticism
- Descartes greatly spread the idea that dreaming may be an epistemological issue.
- The **Cartesian** argument doubts the assumption that it is possible for people to have any knowledge of the physical world.
- Asks how sensory experiences can be reliable when they are so simply mimicked whilst dreaming?
	- If we dream, there are times when we cannot distinguish it from reality.
	- There is not absolute way to determine whether I am awake, or if I'm dreaming.
	- I can't prove I'm not dreaming now.
	- Concludes that if wakefulness is uncertain, then our perception of reality is also uncertain.
- This supports the idea of external-world skepticism, as it shows how people may not have true knowledge of our world.
# Hume's Argument Against Miracles
- Can religious belief be based in revelation?
	- Hume determines that miracles cannot be credible.
- Is it possible to be justified in your belief of a miracle on the basis of empirical evidence?
- Hume determines that it is more realistic to believe that a human has lied or misinterpreted a miracle's occurrence, rather than believe them.
	- The evidence against any miracle will always be greater that that which is for it.
- This is an a priory (necessary truth/)
