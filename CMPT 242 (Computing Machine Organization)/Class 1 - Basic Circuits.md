1. **W** _Chapter_ **_1_** _(introduction) Chapter_ **_22.1-22.3_** _Basic Circuits (1)_

a. List four reasons for studying hardware/low level concepts
1. 
b. What is von Neumann computer architecture (three characteristics)

c. A computing machine based on von Neumann architecture can modify memory, including, possibly, that where the program instructions are stored (self-modifying code). Discuss the wisdom of allowing this to take place. 

d. Explain what happens when you connect resistors (i) in serial (ii) in parallel

e. You have a supply of 10kΩ 5% resistors. (i) how are they marked? (ii) From these, show how to construct a 40kΩ resistor and a 2.5kΩ resistor.
