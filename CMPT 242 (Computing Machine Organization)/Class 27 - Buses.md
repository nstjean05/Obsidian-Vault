## Buses
- Are a mechanism that allows 2 or more units to transfer simultaneously
	- Control lines
	- Data lines
	- 32 or 64 bits
	- These are almost always parallel
- Can be for:
	- Memory - Need address lines as well
	- I/O
- May be:
	- Proprietary / Internal
	- Standard / External / both
- Most buses are shared (Multi-purpose, select with control line)
- Memory devices are usually plugged directly into a bus
## Required
- Access protocol interface (available to CPU & devices & memory)
- Control circuitry to select read/write, device/memory, etc.
- Selection circuitry to select memory location/specific device.
- (may be) slots for plugging in interface cards.
	- These have assigned addresses, may have on board buffer memory, CPU, and control lines at fixed addresses
- Modifying the fetch store cycles
	- Select bus
	- Select device
	- Use control line to select a bus.
	- Use control line to select a device
	- Place address on address lines
	- If storing place data on data lines
	- Specify store or fetch
	- Wait on control lines for operation to complete
	- If fetching, latch data from data lines
	- If fetching, move data from data lines
	- Use control lines to free device
	- Use control lines to free bus
- This is the outline of a bus cycle
- Memory busses are fairly simple
	- Need only interface with memory controller/address decoder to determine when to do fetch/store
- I/O busses are more complicated, because they need:
	- Device select lines
	- Device type lines
	- Device select lines
	- Data direction lines
	- Control data select
	- Reserved memory for control (may include a bit register)
	- Local "intelligence" to execute commands (ROM)
	- Local memory (buffer)
- On boot the BIOS looks for devices containing bootable OS by checking device types - may be able to access manufacturer/date/model/serial number and version of any control ROM
- **Note:** A serial interface has *much* less complexity of hardware, but may not be very fast.
