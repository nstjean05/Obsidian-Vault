# The Craft
- **Anima**: Soul, in Latin
	- **Animate**: Give life to an inanimate object, image, or drawing
	- **Animation**: Display of movement by rapidly displaying many still images
### Cel Animation
- Hand-drawn, and most common traditional method
- Pencil test --> Cleanup --> Ink and Paint
- Foreground contains characters/letters
- Background contains painted or photographic images
### Stop-Motion Animation
- Animate a jointed model and record the different positions on a single frame each
- Used in visual effects in live action films from the 1930s-50s
	- King Kong, etc.
- Miniature models with clay, rubber skin, and a wire skeleton
### Animatronics
- Computer-controlled models which can be animated in real-time
- Eliminate the need for composing later in production
- Programmed with forward and inverse kinematics software
### Performance Animation
- Live character controls the performance of an animated character
- Puppets/actor in a suit
### Character Animation
- Bring life to imagined or virtual characters
- The highest form of animation
- Created using a combination of inverse and forward kinematic techniques, and motion capture
### Effects Animation
- Animation which isn't character oriented
- Natural phenomena (rain, snow, smoke, rivers, etc.)
- Special lighting effects
- Techniques like particle systems, procedural techniques, and dynamic simulations
### Visual Effects for Live Action
- Main goal is to complement the live action
- Animated elements must visually match the live sequence
	- Motion, lighting, perspective, etc.
# Introduction to Computer Animation
- **Computer Animation**: The illusion of movement is created by displaying on a screen a series of individual states of a dynamic scene
- **Computer Animation Sequence**: A set of objects characterized by state variables evolving over time
- **Animators**: Those who design the objects dynamic behaviour
- **Animation Systems**: Provide users with motion control tools
- **Scientific Visualization**: Computer animation helps to understand physical laws when new models are created and simulated
### Animation Types
- **Real Time Animation**: Computer calculates the movement fast enough to see them in real time.
